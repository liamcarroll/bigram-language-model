      <text>I agree with those who said that in my first statement after I testified that it was not contrived enough. I don`t think there is a fancy way to say that I have sinned. It is important for me that everybody who has been hurt to know that the sorrow I feel is genuine. First, the most important - my family, also my friends, my staff, my cabinet, Monica Lewinsky and her family, and the American people. I have asked all for their forgiveness, but I believe that to be forgiven more than sorrow is required. At least two more things. First, genuine repentance and determination to change and repair breaches of my own making.</text>

      <text>This report I received today is a monumental document in more ways than one, but it is a very, very important piece of America’s history and it will shape America’s future in ways that will make us a more honorable, more successful, and more ethical country. What this committee learned I would like to review today with a little more detail than Dr. Fadren said because I think it must be engraved on our national memory. Thousands of government sponsored experiments did take place at hospitals, universities and military bases around our nation. The goal was to understand the effects of radiation exposure on the human body. While most of tests were ethical by any standards, some were unethical, not only by today’s standards but by the standards in the time in which they were conducted. They fail both the test of our national values and the test of humanity. Informed consent means the doctor tells you the risk of the treatment you are about to undergo. In too many cases informed consent was withheld. Americans were kept in the dark about the effects of what was being done to them. The deception extended beyond the test subjects themselves to encompass their families and the American people as a whole for these experiments were kept secret. And they were shrouded not for a compelling reason of national security but for the simple fear of embarrassment, and that was wrong. So today on behalf of another generation of American leaders and another generation of American citizens, the United States of America offers a sincere apology to those of our citizens who were subjected to these experiments, and to their families, and to their communities. When the government does wrong we have a moral responsibility to admit it. The duty we owe to one another to tell the truth and to protect our civil citizens from excesses like these is one we can never walk away from. Our government failed in that duty and it offers an apology to the survivors and their families and to all the American people who must, who must, be able to rely upon the United States to keep its word, to tell the truth and to do the right thing. Make no mistake, as the committee report says, there are circumstances where compensation is appropriate as a matter of ethics and principle. I am committed to seeing to it that the United States of America lives up to its responsibility. Our greatness is measured not only in how we so frequently do right but also how we act when we know we’ve done the wrong thing. How we confront our mistakes, make our apologies, and take action. That’s why this morning I signed an executive order instructing every arm and agency of our government that conducts, supports, or regulates research involving human beings to review immediately their procedures in light of recommendations of this report and the best knowledge and standards today and to report back to me by Christmas.</text>

      <text>I've never said I'm a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that I'm not. I've said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them. Anyone who knows me knows these words don't reflect who I am. I said it, I was wrong and I apologize. I have traveled the country talking about change for America, but my travels have also changed me. I've spent time with grieving mothers who've lost their children, laid-off workers whose jobs have gone to other countries, and people from all walks of life who just want a better future. I have gotten to know the great people of our country and I've been humbled by the faith they've placed in me. I pledge to be a better man tomorrow, and will never, ever let you down. Let's be honest, we're living in the real world. This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we're facing today. We are losing our jobs, we are less safe than we were eight years ago and Washington is totally broken. Hillary Clinton and her kind have run our country into the ground. I've said some foolish things, but there's a big difference between the words and actions of other people. Bill Clinton has actually abused women, and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday.</text>

      <country>Canada</country>
      <text>Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today to offer an apology to former students of Indian residential schools. The treatment of children in Indian residential schools is a sad chapter in our history. In the 1870's, the federal government, partly in order to meet its obligation to educate aboriginal children, began to play a role in the development and administration of these schools. Two primary objectives of the residential schools system were to remove and isolate children from the influence of their homes, families, traditions and cultures, and to assimilate them into the dominant culture. These objectives were based on the assumption aboriginal cultures and spiritual beliefs were inferior and unequal. Indeed, some sought, as it was infamously said, "to kill the Indian in the child. "Today, we recognize that this policy of assimilation was wrong, has caused great harm, and has no place in our country. Most schools were operated as "joint ventures" with Anglican, Catholic, Presbyterian or United churches. The government of Canada built an educational system in which very young children were often forcibly removed from their homes, often taken far from their communities. Many were inadequately fed, clothed and housed. All were deprived of the care and nurturing of their parents, grandparents and communities. First Nations, Inuit and Métis languages and cultural practices were prohibited in these schools. Tragically, some of these children died while attending residential schools and others never returned home. The government now recognizes that the consequences of the Indian residential schools policy were profoundly negative and that this policy has had a lasting and damaging impact on aboriginal culture, heritage and language. While some former students have spoken positively about their experiences at residential schools, these stories are far overshadowed by tragic accounts of the emotional, physical and sexual abuse and neglect of helpless children, and their separation from powerless families and communities. The legacy of Indian residential schools has contributed to social problems that continue to exist in many communities today. It has taken extraordinary courage for the thousands of survivors that have come forward to speak publicly about the abuse they suffered. It is a testament to their resilience as individuals and to the strength of their cultures. Regrettably, many former students are not with us today and died never having received a full apology from the government of Canada. The government recognizes that the absence of an apology has been an impediment to healing and reconciliation. Therefore, on behalf of the government of Canada and all Canadians, I stand before you, in this chamber so central to our life as a country, to apologize to aboriginal peoples for Canada's role in the Indian residential schools system. To the approximately 80,000 living former students, and all family members and communities, the government of Canada now recognizes that it was wrong to forcibly remove children from their homes and we apologize for having done this. We now recognize that it was wrong to separate children from rich and vibrant cultures and traditions, that it created a void in many lives and communities, and we apologize for having done this. We now recognize that, in separating children from their families, we undermined the ability of many to adequately parent their own children and sowed the seeds for generations to follow, and we apologize for having done this. We now recognize that, far too often, these institutions gave rise to abuse or neglect and were inadequately controlled, and we apologize for failing to protect you. Not only did you suffer these abuses as children, but as you became parents, you were powerless to protect your own children from suffering the same experience, and for this we are sorry. The burden of this experience has been on your shoulders for far too long. The burden is properly ours as a government, and as a country. There is no place in Canada for the attitudes that inspired the Indian residential schools system to ever again prevail. You have been working on recovering from this experience for a long time and in a very real sense, we are now joining you on this journey. The government of Canada sincerely apologizes and asks the forgiveness of the aboriginal peoples of this country for failing them so profoundly. We are sorry. In moving towards healing, reconciliation and resolution of the sad legacy of Indian residential schools, implementation of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement agreement began on September 19, 2007.Years of work by survivors, communities, and aboriginal organizations culminated in an agreement that gives us a new beginning and an opportunity to move forward together in partnership. A cornerstone of the settlement agreement is the Indian Residential Schools Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This commission presents a unique opportunity to educate all Canadians on the Indian residential schools system. It will be a positive step in forging a new relationship between aboriginal peoples and other Canadians, a relationship based on the knowledge of our shared history, a respect for each other and a desire to move forward together with a renewed understanding that strong families, strong communities and vibrant cultures and traditions will contribute to a stronger Canada for all of us.</text>

            <text>The treatment of children in Indian residential schools is a sad chapter in our history. In the 1870's, the federal government, partly in order to meet its obligation to educate aboriginal children, began to play a role in the development and administration of these schools. Two primary objectives of the residential schools system were to remove and isolate children from the influence of their homes, families, traditions and cultures, and to assimilate them into the dominant culture. These objectives were based on the assumption aboriginal cultures and spiritual beliefs were inferior and unequal. Indeed, some sought, as it was infamously said, "to kill the Indian in the child. "Today, we recognize that this policy of assimilation was wrong, has caused great harm, Most schools were operated as "joint ventures" with Anglican, Catholic, Presbyterian or United churches. The government of Canada built an educational system in which very young children were often forcibly removed from their homes, often taken far from their communities. Many were inadequately fed, clothed and housed. All were deprived of the care and nurturing of their parents, grandparents and communities. First Nations, Inuit and Métis languages and cultural practices were prohibited in these schools. Tragically, some of these children died while attending residential schools and others never returned home. The government now recognizes that the consequences of the Indian residential schools policy were profoundly negative and that this policy has had a lasting and damaging impact on aboriginal culture, heritage and language. While some former students have spoken positively about their experiences at residential schools, these stories are far overshadowed by tragic accounts of the emotional, physical and sexual abuse and neglect of helpless children, and their separation from powerless families and communities. The legacy of Indian residential schools has contributed to social problems that continue to exist in many communities today. many former students are not with us today and died never having received a full apology from the government of Canada. The government recognizes that the absence of an apology has been an impediment to healing and reconciliation. To the approximately 80,000 living former students, and all family members and communities, the government of Canada now recognizes that it was wrong to forcibly remove children from their homes We now recognize that it was wrong to separate children from rich and vibrant cultures and traditions, that it created a void in many lives and communities, We now recognize that, in separating children from their families, we undermined the ability of many to adequately parent their own children and sowed the seeds for generations to follow, We now recognize that, far too often, these institutions gave rise to abuse or neglect and were inadequately controlled, Not only did you suffer these abuses as children, but as you became parents, you were powerless to protect your own children from suffering the same experience, The burden of this experience has been on your shoulders for far too long. for failing them so profoundly.</text>

            <text>In moving towards healing, reconciliation and resolution of the sad legacy of Indian residential schools, implementation of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement agreement began on September 19, 2007.Years of work by survivors, communities, and aboriginal organizations culminated in an agreement that gives us a new beginning and an opportunity to move forward together in partnership. A cornerstone of the settlement agreement is the Indian Residential Schools Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This commission presents a unique opportunity to educate all Canadians on the Indian residential schools system. It will be a positive step in forging a new relationship between aboriginal peoples and other Canadians, a relationship based on the knowledge of our shared history, a respect for each other and a desire to move forward together with a renewed understanding that strong families, strong communities and vibrant cultures and traditions will contribute to a stronger Canada for all of us.</text>

      <text>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is publishing the report of the Saville inquiry - the tribunal set up by the previous government to investigate the tragic events of 30 January 1972, a day more commonly known as Bloody Sunday. We have acted in good faith by publishing the tribunal's findings as soon as possible after the general election. Mr Speaker, I am deeply patriotic. I never want to believe anything bad about our country. I never want to call into question the behaviour of our soldiers and our army, who I believe to be the finest in the world. And I have seen for myself the very difficult and dangerous circumstances in which we ask our soldiers to serve. But the conclusions of this report are absolutely clear. There is no doubt, there is nothing equivocal, there are no ambiguities. What happened on Bloody Sunday was both unjustified and unjustifiable. It was wrong.</text>

      <text>Politicians and political parties can only grow stronger by acknowledging when they get it wrong and by facing up to their mistakes. So I now apologize sincerely on behalf of my party for the disastrous decision to go to war in Iraq in March 2003. "That apology is owed first of all to the people of Iraq. Hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost and the country is still living with the devastating consequences of the war and the forces it unleashed. They have paid the greatest price for the most serious foreign policy calamity of the last 60 years. The apology is also owed to the families of those soldiers who died in Iraq or who have returned home injured or incapacitated. They did their duty but it was in a conflict they should never have been sent to. Finally, it is an apology to the millions of British citizens who feel our democracy was traduced and undermined by the way in which the decision to go to war was taken on the basic of secret ‘I will be with you, whatever’ understandings given to the US president that have now been publicly exposed.</text>

      <text>First, please let me apologize to my family, friends, staff and fellow Idahoans for the cloud placed over Idaho. I did nothing wrong at the Minneapolis airport. I regret my decision to plead guilty and the sadness that decision has brought to my wife, family, friends, staff, and fellow Idahoans. For that I apologize... Let me be clear. I am not gay and never have been. In June, I overreacted and made a poor decision. While I was not involved in any inappropriate conduct at the Minneapolis airport or anywhere else, I chose to plead guilty to a lesser charge in the hope of making it go away. I did not seek any counsel, either from an attorney, staff, friends, or family. That was a mistake, and I deeply regret it. Because of that, I have now retained counsel and I am asking my counsel to review this matter and to advise me on how to proceed. For a moment, I want to put my state of mind into context on June 11. For eight months leading up to June, my family and I had been relentlessly and viciously harassed by the Idaho Statesman. If you've seen today's paper, you know why. Let me be clear: I am not gay and never have been. Still, without a shred of truth or evidence to the contrary, the Statesman has engaged in this witch hunt. In pleading guilty, I overreacted in Minneapolis, because of the stress of the Idaho Statesman's investigation and the rumors it has fueled around Idaho. Again, that overreaction was a mistake, and I apologize for my misjudgment. Furthermore, I should not have kept this arrest to myself, and should have told my family and friends about it. I wasn't eager to share this failure, but I should have done so anyway. I love my wife, family, friends, staff and Idaho. I love serving Idaho in Congress. Over the years, I have accomplished a lot for Idaho, and I hope Idahoans will allow me to continue to do that. There are still goals I would like to accomplish, and I believe I can still be an effective leader for Idaho. Next month, I will announce, as planned, whether or not I will seek re-election. As an elected official, I fully realize that my life is open for public criticism and scrutiny, and I take full responsibility for the mistake in judgment I made in attempting to handle this matter myself. It is clear, though, that through my actions I have brought a cloud over Idaho. For that, I ask the people of Idaho for their forgiveness.</text>

      <additionalInformation>The Larry Craig scandal was an incident that began on June 11, 2007, with the arrest of Larry Craig—who at the time was a Republican United States Senator from Idaho—for lewd conduct in a men's restroom at the Minneapolis–St. Paul International Airport. Craig later entered a guilty plea to a lesser charge of disorderly conduct on August 8.As a result of the controversy surrounding his arrest, subsequent guilty plea, and pressure from his fellow Republicans, Craig announced his intention to resign from the Senate at a news conference on September 1, which was to become effective on September 30. After Craig's efforts to withdraw his guilty plea failed, on October 4, he released a statement refusing to resign from the Senate. Craig did not run for re-election in 2008 and the incident effectively ended his political career.</additionalInformation>

      <text>I’m sorry. I apologize unreservedly for the real and genuine offence and hurt caused by my tweets and my previous writing. I’m sorry, especially, for the hurt caused to transgender people, who remain sorely oppressed in our society today. Life is a journey towards understanding, and I clearly need to spend more time than I already have done listening to transgender people, and if anyone would like spare the time to share their experiences and explain what I and fellow Greens can do to help them I would be grateful for that opportunity. I am taking the LGBTIQ Greens up in their offer extended in their statement, of engaging with them to come to understand better. I am deeply sorry for the offence and hurt caused by the manner in which I have spoken about all this. I take responsibility for that. The Green Party believes unequivocally in feminism, queer rights, and trans rights, principles I believe in absolutely. Opposing the ongoing horrifying discrimination faced by trans people is absolutely vital, and I am proud to be in a party which has a long history of doing just that. I apologize for the way in which my comments have got in the way of this. I will listen to what those who have been hurt by what I’ve said are saying, and I hope to learn from the whole affair, and to improve my understanding of these matters.</text>

I am confident this decision is the right decision for myself and for the people of Calgary Nose Hill. I have decided to step down as a #LPC candidate.</text>

      <text>I regret the comments that I’ve made, as many as ten years ago and for these I apologize. During this time, as a gay teenager and someone who was struggling, I felt an overwhelming pressure and made incorrect statements to mask the confusion I was feeling. I did this in order to present an image of myself that I felt was expected of a straight man. Since that time I have been active in the LGBT community and have worked to serve the people in our community as best as I can. I have served on the board of directors for a respected organization, OutSport Toronto, known for promoting the participation of sport activities within the LGBT community, in addition to advocacy against LGBT discrimination in sport. I have also been a long-time supporter of LGBT charities, AIDS service charities and community athletics. I’m grateful to offer my support 10 years later, toward some of the support structures that are so necessary to help LGBT youth who were in the same position that I was in. My hope is that they don’t feel alone or afraid, and that they can access organizations that are here to support them. I look forward to continue working to serve my community and I commit to representing their best interests if elected as the Member of Parliament for Toronto Centre. I will not comment further on these decade old posts. My priority today is focused on promoting Stephen Harper’s plan to create jobs, cut taxes and keep our communities safe.”</text>

      <additionalInformation>A Progressive Conservative party board member apologized on Monday for "body shaming" Alberta's new health minister. In a post on Facebook, PC Alberta Southern Vice-President Jordan Lien blasted the NDP government's decision to include menthol products in the province's ban on flavoured tobacco effective September 30. The decision was announced by new NDP Health Minister Sarah Hoffman in a news conference over the weekend. "So if I'm understanding this correctly...our morbidly obese Health Minister Sarah Hoffman is going to ban the sale of menthol tobacco products in Alberta as of September," Lien wrote. "Where does the nanny state begin and end? I would assume then that if health is the chief concern, that all sodas, candy, processed sugar products (all bazillion of them) and fast foods, etc. should then follow? As well as as all flavoured liquor products etc? Ridiculous." The post was widely circulated on Twitter, where Lien was accused of "body shaming" Hoffman. Interim PC Leader Ric McIver said he had not seen the post but is not in favour of "negative personal comments." "All Albertans must be respected, all Albertans must be treated with dignity and if a member of our party has fallen short, we will have a discussion about that," he said.</additionalInformation>

The tweet was wrong on the facts, wrong in tone and should not have happened. We would like to offer a sincere apology to Senator Tim Kaine, his family, and his Marine son who is honorably serving overseas. The members of the staff that were invoked are facing severe internal sanctions and mandatory retraining. When we learned of our mistake, we immediately took steps to rectify it. There are now procedural measures in place to make sure it does not happen again. While I did not see or authorize the tweet, as the Director of our organization I take full responsibility for our carelessness. Again, we are incredibly thankful for the service of Sen. Kaine’s son, and all United States military, past and present, who fight for our freedom. We demand accountability from our elected officials and our government. Those standards apply do and should apply to us as well.</text>

      <additionalInformation>SALT LAKE CITY (ABC4 Utah) - Utah Republican Party Chairman James Evans is apologizing after his outburst on CNN Thursday morning. During a talk back with CNN's Carol Costello and Utah Democratic Chairman Peter Corroon, James challenged the cable network to investigate Bill Clinton's alleged illegitimate son. James Evans: "We're the party of family values, but I want to make this one last point if I could. And, and I'm looking forward to the interview you're gonna have with Bill Clinton's illegitimate son and ask Hillary Clinton if she's willing to accept him. Carol Costello: "No, no, no, no, no, come on. Oh please, that's, that's just rubbish. He does not have an illegitimate son. You have no proof of that. (Overtalk) you were just talking about people being salacious... James Evans: "How do you know this?! Have him on the air."</additionalInformation>

      <additionalInformation>EDMONTON — The former leader of the Reform Party says he made a mistake when he encouraged members of Alberta’s Wildrose to unite with the governing Progressive Conservatives without first consulting the grassroots of the party. Preston Manning met last week with the Wildrose caucus to talk about his experiences when the Reform Party joined the federal Conservatives to form the Canadian Alliance. A day after the meeting, Wildrose leader Danielle Smith and eight others crossed the floor of the provincial legislature and called on the party to merge with the Tories. Mr. Manning said in a statement Monday that he should have recommended more consultation with constituents in the meeting with Wildrose. He said the Canadian Alliance formed only after a discussion with grassroots members and several conferences and referendums.</additionalInformation>

      <additionalInformation>Tony Smith and other former residents of the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children never thought they’d get to hear those words, but on Friday Premier Stephen McNeil delivered them on behalf of the government, bringing to a close a dark chapter in this province’s history. The home, which started as an orphanage primarily for black children, has come to be known as a place where residents were subject to emotional, physical and sexual abuse at the hands of staff. After years of struggling to have the matter recognized and receive justice, former residents recently settled a class action with the province for $30 million. McNeil said previous governments put off addressing the residents’ concerns, suggesting it wasn’t their problem. During the last election campaign McNeil said he would settle the lawsuit, and after he was elected, announced he would offer the formal apology.</additionalInformation>

The Liberals are the first party to dump a candidate after the deadline for withdrawals on Sept. 28, meaning Thomas' name will still appear on the ballot on Oct. 19. If she wins, a by-election might be called in Victoria. In 2013, Thomas wrote on Facebook that mosques were once education centres but were now used "as brainwashing stations." Her comments were discovered by the satirical news website The True North Times.</additionalInformation>

        U.S. Senate candidate and former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland has apologized after saying Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia’s death “happened at a good time.”
        Mr. Strickland, a Democrat, was speaking at an AFL-CIO event in Cleveland Monday when he said Scalia’s death “saved labor” from a major blow in March. With Scalia’s seat vacant, the justices ended in a 4-4 deadlock in a case challenging the right of public-sector unions to collect dues from workers who decide not to join the union and pay for collective bargaining activities, The Washington Examiner reported.
        “In about three-and-a-half months, we’ll make a decision about who occupies the executive branch, what party controls the Senate, and growing out of those two decisions will be the future of the United States Supreme Court,” Mr. Stricklandtold attendees. “And my friends, a lot of average citizens out there don’t understand the importance of that court.
        “I mean, the death of Scalia saved labor from a terrible decision,” he said to cheers. “And I don’t wish anyone ill, but it happened at a good time because once that decision had been made, it would have been tough to reverse it.”

      <text>Mr. Speaker and members of this assembly, on Thursday afternoon last week during time allotted for members' statements, I made a number of comments that were wrong, improper, inappropriate and extremely unparliamentary. I want to stand in the House today, apologize for my behaviour and retract those remarks. First, I want to apologize to the House for these remarks, as they were, as I said, improper, wrong and extremely unparliamentary. Since being elected as the member for Charlottetown about seven years ago, I have attempted to conduct myself with dignity and honour, in other words, in a manner that acknowledges and respects the importance and significance of this institution. That certainly was not the case last Thursday afternoon. I deeply regret my actions. Second, I want to sincerely apologize to the Right Hon. Brian Mulroney and his family. Although the remarks were rhetorical and meant solely as hyperbole, they were highly improper and ought not to have been made. I sincerely apologize to him and his family, and I do hope he accepts my apology. Third, I want to apologize to my colleague and friend, the member of Parliament for Abbotsford. He had the floor at the time my remarks were made and they should not have been made. I should not have been saying anything at that particular time, let alone what I did say. Also, I want to apologize to you, Mr. Speaker. You have a difficult job in this highly partisan environment. You do a good job. I did not make your job any easier. I want to apologize for my behaviour. I also want to apologize to my family, immediate and extended, for any embarrassments caused to them. They have come to expect better of me. On this occasion, I feel that I have let them down. I could go on and give some reasons or excuses or try to explain to the House what was going on in my mind at that particular moment. I will not, because I feel I would only detract from my apology and retraction. I want my statement to be full, frank, unqualified and without any qualifications whatsoever. In other words, I accept total responsibility for my inappropriate words. In closing, I repeat that I do apologize for my inappropriate remarks and I do hope that all members of this assembly will accept my apology and retraction. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allotting me the time to address this House.</text>

        Charlottetown MP Shawn Murphy formally apologized Monday in the federal House of Commons for calling for former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney to be hanged.
        During parliamentary proceedings in Ottawa last Thursday, Ed Fast, a Conservative MP from B.C. who sits next to Murphy, rose to congratulate his party on the passage of his government's new crime bill.
        That's when Murphy leaned toward his microphone and yelled, "Hang him high, hang Mulroney! Let's get this Mulroney before the courts as soon as possible and hang him high! We gotta get Mulroney, put a noose on his head, put a noose on his head. Get tough on crime."

Last night, I publicly commented on the NBA and I sincerely apologize to those who I unfairly categorized. The NBA has many examples of players and owners who are role models for our communities and for our country. Those individuals did not deserve that criticism and I apologize.

      <additionalInformation>Last week we reported on Mike Yenni, a Republican politician representing Louisiana’s largest parish, who is being investigated by the FBI for allegedly having sexted a 17-year-old male. Yenni is married with a three-year-old daughter. He reportedly met the teen at a function at the teen’s Catholic high school when he was mayor of Kenner, Louisiana in 2015. Yenni, 40, is a Louisiana Catholic high school alum though it’s unclear if he attended the same school as the boy with whom he began sexting. Seventeen is the age of consent in Louisiana. According to the teen, Yenni was introduced to him by a mutual friend who was 19 at the time.</additionalInformation>

        Canadian MP Larry Miller has apologized after his statement saying Muslim women who do not want to remove their face-coverings when taking the citizenship oath should, "stay the hell where [they] come from." Miller's comments came when the case of Zunera Ishaq, a woman fighting in court to wear her niqab at the citizenship ceremony, was being discussed on a local call-in radio show.
        "Frankly if you're not willing to show your face in a ceremony that you're joining the best country in the world ... if you don't like that or don't want to do that, stay the hell where you came from," said Miller.

        The Liberal candidate for the riding of Kitchener South-Hespeler apologized Thursday for two statements he made earlier in the week at a debate.
        During Monday’s forum, which was organized by the Greater Kitchener-Waterloo Chamber of Commerce, Marwan Tabbara said that Jean Chretien refused to send troops into Afghanistan when he was prime minister.
        “In 2003 … he said ‘I will not go into Afghanistan, I will not go into Iraq,” Tabbara said.

      <additionalInformation>U.S. Senate candidate Loretta Sanchez apologized Sunday after a videotape surfaced showing her making a whooping cry in reference to Native Americans that brought her a cascade of reprimands from fellow Democrats. Speaking to party activists at a state Democratic convention Sunday, Sanchez described herself as a longtime champion of civil and human rights who has Native American blood in her mother's family. She said she had a hectic day of speeches and handshaking at the convention Saturday and was not the type of politician routinely managed or sheltered by "handlers."</additionalInformation>

        "My actions were inexcusable. I do want my constituents to know that my poor judgment for a few moments on Monday in no way means I ignored your interests in representing you on this very serious matter," "Over the past seven months, as a member of the General Assembly's Finance Committee, I have participated fully in the budget process and have played an active role in crafting a budget that provides the necessary services that our communities so desperately need while at the same time minimizing any negative impact on the city of Bridgeport and its people."
        "I sincerely apologize to each of you. I look forward to having the continued privilege of representing you and your interests in Hartford. I thank you in advance for your understanding and have been humbled by those of you who have already expressed your understanding and forgiveness,".

As somebody who has been, in their personal life, deeply affected by cancer, my intent was certainly not to show any disrespect for cancer victims, survivors or their families. However it is clear that these remarks have been interpreted in that way. So I want to offer a clear apology to anyone who has been offended by what I said. I want people to know that when I was 11 years old I watched my father pass away from colon cancer over a period of 18 months. My mother and I and my brother took care of him until his final days. Twenty years later I was in the room with my brother as he died from lung cancer.</text>

        Your Excellencies,
        I apologise unreservedly for my intemperate language during a press conference yesterday to launch proposals for a new procurement policy for the UK.
        I have very great respect for your nations and people. Indeed I have enjoyed working closely with members of your armed forces over many years and have always been aware of their significant contribution to NATO and their sacrifice in conflict.
        If you were able to view the question asked at the conference and my full response, I hope you would see that my exasperation was directed not at Belgium and Denmark in themselves but at those pundits whom I regard as naïve, continually trying to compare the United Kingdom's geo-strategic status with that of countries whose size and history have made us very different nations.
        It was not my intention to give offence and I do regret any caused.

        "Therefore, I sincerely apologize to everybody that was offended by the materials I posted. I truly never meant any racial disrespect. I apologize to them and all citizens of Lubbock for the distraction this has caused from the work I have been elected to do.
        "I apologize to members of the judiciary. As a judge, either of the Commissioners' Court or of a Civil or Criminal Court, we are held to higher standards, and my actions have brought reproach to these individuals and myself, and I apologize and ask for your forgiveness.
        "I apologize to the members of the Republican Party. I never intended for my actions to label my political party as in any way promoting racism. It was not my intent to do so, and it certainly was not the party's intent. We are a conservative party, and we welcome diversity. Our conservative values have no room for callous or insensitive remarks or materials, even if it was unintentional." "I would like to restate, for the record, that there are many forums available for political material, but the courthouse should not be one of them ... I was wrong and I will never do so again ... I hope one day I can regain your trust and not just as an elected official, but as your servant, friend and neighbor. Again, I would ask your forgiveness.
        "May God bless this community and our country."

      <additionalInformation>Twenty-nine years after the murder of high school student Helen Betty Osborne outside the town of The Pas, her family has received the Manitoba government's apology for bungling its investigation of the case. On July 14, Manitoba Justice Minister Gord Mackintosh admitted that his department's predecessors in the former Conservative government had mishandled the 1971 criminal investigation. As a result, no charges were laid for 16 years. Only one man was convicted of killing the girl from Norway House, although four were directly implicated.</additionalInformation>

        'Thank you for being here tonight on this very solemn and somber occasion.
        'I begin with an admission and an apology. First, I recognize fully that I am a balding, youngish, middle-aged straight, white, male, Republican, politician... with all of the expectations and privileges that come with those labels. I am probably not who you expected to hear from today.
        'I'm here because, yesterday morning, 49 Americans were brutally murdered. !!!And it made me sad. And it made me angry. And it made me confused. !!! I'm here because those 49 people were gay. I'm here because it shouldn't matter. But I'm here because it does.
        'I am not here to tell you that I know exactly what you are going through. I am not here to tell you that I feel your pain. I don't pretend to know the depths of what you are feeling right now. But I do know what it feels like to be scared. And I do know what it feels like to be sad. And I do know what it feels like to be rejected. And, more importantly, I know what it feels like to be loved. 'I grew up in a small town and went to a small rural high school. There were some kids in my class that were different. Sometimes I wasn't kind to them. I didn't know it at the time, but I know now that they were gay. I will forever regret not treating them with the kindness, dignity, and respect - the love - that they deserved. For that, I sincerely and humbly apologize.
        'Over the intervening years, my heart has changed. It has changed because of you. It has changed because I have gotten to know many of you. You have been patient with me. You helped me learn the right letters of the alphabet in the right order even though you keep adding new ones. You have been kind to me. Jim Dabakis even told me I dressed nice once, even though I know he was lying. You have treated me with the kindness, dignity, and respect - the love - that I very often did NOT deserve. And it has made me love you.
        'But now we are here. We are here because 49 beautiful, amazing people are gone. These are not just statistics. These were individuals. These are human beings. They each have a story. They each had dreams, goals, talents, friends, family. They are you and they are me. And one night they went out to relax, to laugh, to connect, to forget, to remember. And in a few minutes of chaos and terror, they were gone. 'I believe that we can all agree we have come a long way as a society when it comes to our acceptance and understanding of the LGBTQ community (did I get that right?).
        However, there has been something about this tragedy that has very much troubled me. I believe that there is a question, two questions actually, that each of us needs to ask ourselves in our heart of hearts. And I am speaking now to the straight community. How did you feel when you heard that 49 people had been gunned down by a self-proclaimed terrorist? That's the easy question. Here is the hard one: Did that feeling change when you found out the shooting was at a gay bar at 2 a.m. in the morning? If that feeling changed, then we are doing something wrong.
        'So now we find ourselves at a crossroads. A crossroads of hate and terror. How do we respond? How do you respond? Do we lash out with anger, hate and mistrust? Or do we, as Lincoln begged, appeal to the 'better angels of our nature?'
        'Usually when tragedy occurs, we see our nation come together. I was saddened, yesterday to see far too many retreating to their over-worn policy corners and demagoguery. Let me be clear, there are no simple policy answers to this tragedy. Beware of anyone who tells you that they have the easy solution. It doesn't exist. And I can assure you this - that calling people idiots, communists, fascists or bigots on Facebook is not going to change any hearts or minds. Today we need fewer Republicans and fewer Democrats. Today we need more Americans.
        'But just because an easy solution doesn't exist, doesn't mean we shouldn't try. The greatest generations in the history of the world were never innately great. They became great because of how they responded in the face of evil. Their humanity is measured by their response to ha
        'I truly believe that this is the defining issue of our generation. Can we be brave? Can we be strong? Can we be kind and, perhaps, even happy, in the face of atrocious acts of hate and terrorism? Do we find a way to unite? Or do these atrocities further corrode and divide our torn nation? Can we, the citizens of the great state of Utah, lead the nation with love in the face of adversity? Can WE become a greatest generation?
        'I promise we can. But I also promise it will never happen if we leave it to the politicians. Ultimately, there is only one way for us to come together. It must happen at a personal level. We must learn to truly love one another.
        'The Prophet Muhammad is reported to have said: 'You will not enter paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another.'
        'Jesus said, 'Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you.'
        'Now, you know a little something about hate. And you know a little something about persecution. But you also know something about loving, blessing, and doing good. What our country needs more than ever is less politics and more kindness. If nothing else, as we can see here tonight, this tragedy has the potential to bring us closer than ever before.
        'And so may we leave today, with a resolve to be a little kinder. May we try to listen more and talk less. May we forgive someone that has wronged us. And perhaps, most importantly, try to love someone that is different than us. For my straight friends, might I suggest starting with someone who is gay.
        'I leave you with the words of Lyndon B. Johnson. They were spoken at another very sad time in our history, the death of President John F. Kennedy. He said this:
        'Our enemies have always made the same mistake. In my lifetime - in depression and in war - they have awaited our defeat. Each time, from the secret places of the American heart, came forth the faith they could not see or that they could not even imagine. It brought us victory. And it will again. For this is what America is all about.'
        'On behalf of the 3 million people of the state of Utah, We Are Orlando. We love you. And I love you.'

      <additionalInformation>Last week's shooting at Republican lawmakers on a baseball field is playing a major role in the Georgia special election set to take place Tuesday. The GOP chairman of a nearby congressional district had to retract his comments Monday after he said that the shooting would lead to a victory for Republicans in the election between Karen Handel, the GOP former secretary of state in Georgia, and Jon Ossoff, a Democrat and former congressional aide in the district. I’ll tell you what: I think the shooting is going to win this election for us,” Brad Carver told The Washington Post. Carver is the GOP chairman of the nearby 11th district of Georgia. Carver continued: “Moderates and independents in this district are tired of left-wing extremism. I get that there’s extremists on both sides, but we are not seeing them. We’re seeing absolute resistance to everything this president does. Moderates and independents out there want to give him a chance.

      <additionalInformation>Mississippi State Rep. Karl Oliver has apologized for a Facebook posting over the weekend in which he suggested the "leadership" of New Orleans should be "lynched" over the removal of four controversial Confederate-era monuments. Oddly, though, he apologized to "my colleagues and fellow Mississippians," rather than New Orleanians. The post, which later was removed, said: "The destruction of these monuments, erected in the loving memory of our family and fellow Southern Americans, is both heinous and horrific. If the, and I use this term extremely loosely, "leadership" of Louisiana wishes to, in a Nazi-ish fashion, burn books or destroy historical monuments of OUR HISTORY, they should be LYNCHED! Let it be known, I will do all in my power to prevent this from happening in our State."</additionalInformation>

      <additionalInformation>The Prime Minister has promised to answer questions from the public in the language they are asked, after receiving a slew of complaints from angry citizens who felt he recently violated the country’s bilingualism policy. On a stop in Sherbrooke, Que., during his January cross-country tour, Trudeau insisted on speaking only in French, even in response to questions asked in English from the province’s anglophone minority. His actions were called “tone deaf” in the media and they triggered a series of complaints to the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages. A Montreal-based anglophone ad vocacy group, which sent a critical letter to the prime minister about the town hall, received a formal apology from Trudeau on Feb. 14 and published his letter on its website Monday</additionalInformation>

      <text>There are not many things that I regret about my time as an MP but almost as soon as I voted against same sex marriage I knew I had made a mistake. Of course I recognized that it was going to go pass anyway so my vote was not crucial and I was wavering. I excused myself with my children with the excuse that I would have voted for it had civil partnerships been allowed for heterosexual couples and I still think that should be actively considered but in the end as a Government Whip I was a teller and therefore technically didn't vote one way or the other. That was not courageous. I think I was just not ready for this step, conflicted between many of my age group and those of the younger generation whose views I wanted to understand. Ultimately I think I knew that I was going to be on the wrong side as those who wanted to me to vote for were some of the nicest people I came across, something that couldn't be said about those opposing. With hindsight I wish I had spoken to a very good friend and colleague before the vote. He might easily have been expected to oppose the move to same sex marriage but he said to me that it was something that wouldn't affect him at all but would give great happiness to many people. That is an argument that I find it difficult to find fault with. So three years on I can honestly say, I was wrong and I am sorry not to have been able to see it at the time.</text>

      <additionalInformation> The decision by President Franklin Roosevelt to round up Japanese citizens and imprison them in camps came just 10 weeks after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, but the effects resonated through American culture for decades. During World War II, 120,000 Japanese-Americans and permanent residents were forced to abandon their homes and belongings in order to live under guard at several camps scattered throughout the U.S. due to racist fears that these citizens were loyal first and foremost to Japan. Not only were Americans deprived of their homes and belongings, but they were offered little during the decades after the end of the war to make up for their wrongful imprisonment.Thanks to the activism of Japanese-Americans like Yuri Kochiyama (who was given a Google Doodle treatment recently in honor of her 95th birthday), in 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act, which offered every Japanese-American interned in the camps during the war a formal apology and $20,000 in compensation, Story Hinckley writes for the Christian Science Monitor.</additionalInformation>

      <additionalInformation>During Germany’s occupation of France in World War II, Klaus Barbie was one of the most infamous Gestapo officers. Nicknamed “the Butcher of Lyon,” Barbie was responsible for overseeing the murder and torture of French Jews and members of the French Resistance, as well as deporting thousands of Jews and noncombatants to concentration camps. When the war came to an end, Barbie slipped out of Germany and fled to Italy, then to Bolivia in 1951. In a 1983 investigation spurred by charges from the French that the U.S. government had shielded Barbie after the war, officials with the U.S. Justice Department discovered that he had, in fact, been protected by several high-ranking members of the U.S. Army during the post-war occupation of Germany, Stuart Taylor, Jr. reported for the New York Times. The investigation found that the Army had been using Barbie as a paid informant during the last few years of the war and helped him escape to Bolivia in order to hide this fact from the public. To do so, the Army lied in response to inquiries about Barbie’s whereabouts, though the report found that they cut ties with the Nazi officer after relocating him to South America. In 1983, Barbie was finally extradited to France to face trial for war crimes. The U.S. issued a formal apology for hiding him later that year.</additionalInformation>

      <additionalInformation>During World War II, scientists working for the U.S. Public Health Service started one of the most infamous and unethical medical studies undertaken during the 20th century: the Tuskegee Experiment. Starting in 1932, doctors working with the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama began conducting a long-term study on hundreds of black men to learn about the long-term progression of syphilis. The men were never informed that they were subjects of a study, and were never actually given the medical treatments that doctors told them they were receiving. In exchange for their unknowing participation, 399 black men living with syphilis were instead given meals, free medical exams, and free burial services after their deaths. The study was originally meant to last six months, and it ended up running for 40 years—long after the discovery of penicillin and other medical treatments for the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The experiment was uncovered by an investigation by the Associated Press in 1972, resulting in a $10 million settlement with the surviving subjects. President Bill Clinton formally apologized for the unethical experiments in 1997. </additionalInformation>

Both President Bush and Secretary of State Powell have expressed their sincere regret over your missing pilot and aircraft. Please convey to the Chinese people and to the family of pilot Wang Wei that we are very sorry for their loss. Although the full picture of what transpired is still unclear, according to our information, our severely crippled aircraft made an emergency landing after following international emergency procedures.We are very sorry the entering of China's airspace and the landing did not have verbal clearance, but very pleased the crew landed safely. We appreciate China's efforts to see to the well-being of our crew. In view of the tragic incident and based on my discussions with your representative, we have agreed to the following actions: Both sides agree to hold a meeting to discuss the incident. My government understands and expects that our aircrew will be permitted to depart China as soon as possible. The meeting would start April 18, 2001.The meeting agenda would include discussion of the causes of the incident, possible recommendations whereby such collisions could be avoided in the future, development of a plan for prompt return of the EP-3 aircraft, and other related issues. We acknowledge your government's intention to raise US reconnaissance missions near China in the meeting. Sincerely,  Joseph W Prueher</text>

      <additionalInformation>South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford has a way with words, especially when those words are "I'm sorry." After returning from a mysterious weeklong disappearance from his state in June 2009 (at first his staff famously claimed he was hiking the Appalachian Trail), the 49-year-old confessed to an extramarital affair with a woman in Argentina and offered apologies to no fewer than five groups of people: his family, staff, friends, people of faith and "anybody who lives in South Carolina." The apology tour continued that week during a meeting with his cabinet and, in case anyone didn't get the message, in a column he wrote the following month in South Carolina's largest newspaper. His torrent of regrets may not have been good enough — as of early December 2009, state legislators were discussing whether Sanford should be impeached.</additionalInformation>

      <text>I apologize for causing offense. I should not have said what I did. I’ll share with you the context of the comment I made because I was not attempting to compare my filibuster to that suffering. It was at the end of what had been nearly 22 hours and I was thanking the floor staff. There are a number of staff on the Senate floor who had to be there the whole night and they didn’t have a choice on it. So I actually put together a list of everyone on the floor staff and all of the police officers and all of the pages and everyone who was forced to stay there all night. And it was in the context of thanking them for enduring. And that’s when I used the analogy. I was trying to say that they had endured a long period of suffering not of their choosing. But I understand that that comment caused offense and I apologize, that was not my intention to do so. In fact my intention was to thank them for their service.</text>

      <additionalInformation> Wrapping up his 21-hour fake filibuster calling for the defunding of Obamacare, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) jokingly thanked his staff “who have endured this Bataan death march” last week. The lighthearted comparison outraged veterans of the actual 1942 death march, who confronted Cruz in his office on Monday.The American Coalition for Filipino Veterans issued a letter demanding an apology for Cruz’s “ill-advised, and insulting televised statement.” During the Bataan Death March, Japanese troops killed more than 10,000 American and Filipino prisoners of war during a five-day 65-mile march to a Japanese prison camp. Beatings and random executions were common, and hundreds died from heat, exhaustion, or starvation along the way. Once the survivors arrived at the camp, about 400 prisoners died every day from starvation or disease.“There is no logical reason to compare the brutal imprisonment, suffering, tortures and executions faced by the heroic Fil-Am POWs/Death March WWII survivors with the victims of your grandstanding,” the group wrote.On Monday, Cruz met with 96-year-old ACFV spokesman Mr. Celestino Almeda and 93-year-old Major Jesse Baltazar, a Bataan defender and prisoner of war. The senator apologized, explaining that his intentions were good. </additionalInformation>

      <additionalInformation> Dwyane Wade didn't make any friends north of the border Sunday when the future Hall of Famer continued to throw up shots during the Canadian anthem before Game 3 between the Heat and Raptors in Miami.For a subsection of northerly fans, Wade's actions came across as insensitive, if not disrespectful, conjuring up memories of the 1992 World Series when a Marine Corps Color Guard carried the Canadian flag upside down during the national anthems prior to Game 2 between the Toronto Blue Jays and Atlanta Braves.Like Saturday's controversial incident in Miami, the 1992 mishap happened in the United States, on national TV no less, in what was just the second World Series game ever to feature a Canadian team.</additionalInformation>

        235 - Letters to the Commandant of the Marine Corps League and to the Commandant of the Marine Corps. My dear Mr. Nixon:I am concerned over the situation which has arisen because of the publishing of my letter of August 29th to Representative McDonough.I have this date addressed a letter to the Commandant of the Marine Corps, a copy of which I am enclosing.I should be happy to have you read my letter to the members of your organization.Sincerely yours,HARRY S TRUMAN.[Commandant Clay Nixon, Marine Corps League, Hotel Statler, Washington, D.C.]Dear General Cates:I sincerely regret the unfortunate choice of language which I used in my letter of August 29 to Congressman McDonough concerning the Marine Corps.What I had in mind at the time this letter was written was the specific question raised by Mr. McDonough, namely the representation of the Marine Corps on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I have been disturbed by the number of communications which have been brought to my attention proposing that the Marine Corps have such representation. I feel that, in as much as the Marine Corps is by law an integral part of the Department of the Navy, it is already represented on the Joint Chiefs of Staff by the Chief of Naval Operations. That the Congress concurs in this point of view is evidenced by the fact that, in passing the National Security Act of 1947, and again in amending that Act in 1949, the Congress considered the question of Marine Corps representation on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and did not provide for it. It is my feeling that many of the renewed pleas for such representation are the result of propaganda inspired by individuals who may not be aware of the best interests of our Defense Establishment as a whole, and it was this feeling which I was expressing to Mr. McDonough. I am certain that the Marine Corps itself does not indulge in such propaganda.I am profoundly aware of the magnificent history of the United States Marine Corps, and of the many heroic deeds of the Marines since the Corps was established in 1775. I personally learned of the splendid combat spirit of the Marines when the Fourth Marine Brigade of the Second Infantry Division fought in France in 1918.On numerous occasions since I assumed office, I have stated my conviction that the Marine Corps has a vital role in our organization for national security and I will continue to support and maintain its identity.I regard the Marine Corps as a force available for use in any emergency, wherever or whenever necessary. When I spoke of the Marines as the "Navy's police force," I had in mind its immediate readiness, and the provision of the National Security Act which states that "The Marine Corps shall be organized, trained, and equipped to provide fleet marine forces of combined arms, together with supporting air components, for service with the fleet in the seizure or defense of advanced naval bases and for the conduct of such land operations as may be essential to the prosecution of a naval campaign."The Corps' ability to carry out whatever task may be assigned to it has been splendidly demonstrated many times in our history. It has again been shown by the immediate response of the Marine Corps to a call for duty in Korea. Since Marine ground and air forces have arrived in Korea I have received a daily report of their actions. The country may feel sure that the record of the Marines now fighting there will add new laurels to the already illustrious record of the Marine Corps.Sincerely yours,HARRY S. TRUMAN

      <text>A monetary sum and words alone cannot restore lost years or erase painful memories; neither can they fully convey our Nation’s resolve to rectify injustice and to uphold the rights of individuals. We can never fully right the wrongs of the past. But we can take a clear stand for justice and recognize that serious injustices were done to Japanese Americans during World War II. In enacting a law calling for restitution and offering a sincere apology, your fellow Americans have, in a very real sense, renewed their traditional commitment to the ideals of freedom, equality, and justice. You and your family have our best wishes for the future. George Bush</text>

      <name>We Made a Devil's Bargain": Fmr. President Clinton Apologizes for Trade Policies that Destroyed Haitian Rice Farming</name>

      <text>Since 1981, the United States has followed a policy, until the last year or so when we started rethinking it, that we rich countries that produce a lot of food should sell it to poor countries and relieve them of the burden of producing their own food, so, thank goodness, they can leap directly into the industrial era. It has not worked. It may have been good for some of my farmers in Arkansas, but it has not worked. It was a mistake. It was a mistake that I was a party to. I am not pointing the finger at anybody. I did that. I have to live every day with the consequences of the lost capacity to produce a rice crop in Haiti to feed those people, because of what I did. Nobody else.So we genuinely thought we were helping Haiti when we restored President Aristide, made a commitment to help rebuild the infrastructure through the Army Corps of Engineers there, and do a lot of other things. And we made this devil’s bargain on rice. And it wasn’t the right thing to do. We should have continued to work to help them be self-sufficient in agriculture. And we — that’s a lot of what we’re doing now.</text>

      <additionalInformation>President Bill Clinton, now the UN Special Envoy to Haiti, publicly apologized last month for forcing Haiti to drop tariffs on imported, subsidized US rice during his time in office. The policy wiped out Haitian rice farming and seriously damaged Haiti’s ability to be self-sufficient. On Wednesday, journalist Kim Ives of Haiti Libertéquestioned Clinton about his change of heart and his stance on the return of ousted Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.</additionalInformation>

      <additionalInformation>President Clinton expressed regret today for the U.S. role in Guatemala's 36-year civil war, saying that Washington "was wrong" to have supported Guatemalan security forces in a brutal counterinsurgency campaign that slaughtered thousands of civilians.Clinton's statements marked the first substantive comment from the administration since an independent commission concluded last month that U.S.-backed security forces committed the vast majority of human rights abuses during the war, including torture, kidnapping and the murder of thousands of rural Mayans.</additionalInformation>

      <additionalInformation>Speaking at the annual NAACP convention on Wednesday, former President Bill Clinton apologized for the draconian sentencing laws he signed while in office “that only made the problem worse,” the New York Times’ Peter Baker reports.Clinton was referring to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which put 100,000 more police officers into circulation, banned a number of high-caliber assault rifles and introduced more comprehensive background checks for some gun purchases — but it also included harsher sentences for federal prisoners, setting a trend that trickled down to the state level.</additionalInformation>

      <additionalInformation>Former U.S. President Bill Clinton apologized for drug cartel violence in Mexico because of America's war on drugs. Clinton was referring to the U.S. drug enforcement policy that began under Former U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, Huffington Post reports. The policy shut down the Caribbean Sea, since it was the route used for trafficking drugs between the U.S. and South and Central America. Although the smuggling stopped in the water, dealers shifted to trafficking drugs over land through Mexico. Plus, Clinton's administration opened the border to Mexico, empowering the country's drug dealers and leading to a spike in violence.Now, the country has about six powerful and violent drug cartels, causing mass murders and government corruption in Mexico.</additionalInformation>

      <additionalInformation>President Barack Obama apologized for Americans who have been affected by complications of the health care rollout. It is the first time the president has personally apologized for the glitches. The president’s apology comes as the White House tries to combat a cascade of troubles surrounding the rollout of the health care law often referred to as “Obamacare.” The healthcare.gov website that was supposed to be an easy portal for Americans to purchase insurance has been riddled by technical issues. And with at least 3.5 million Americans receiving cancellation notices from their insurance companies, there’s new scrutiny aimed at the way the president tried to sell the law to the public in the first place.</additionalInformation>

      <additionalInformation>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has apologized 'unreservedly' for elbowing a female opposition member of Parliament in the chest as he waded through a group of her colleagues.Ruth Ellen Brosseau said the fracas forced her to miss a vote in the House of Commons on Wednesday as she had to leave the chamber.'I was elbowed in the chest by the prime minister and then I had to leave. It was very overwhelming,' she said. 'I missed the vote because of this.'Opposition leaders have slammed the incident as 'violent' - branding Trudeau, an avid boxer, 'un-statesmanlike'.Reports claim Trudeau shouted 'get the f*** out the way' during the dispute.  The kerfuffle spells a possible blow to Trudeau's image as a modern, feminist leader.</additionalInformation>

      <additionalInformation>Prime Minister David Cameron apologized Wednesday for the “appalling” standard of care at a British hospital and said doctors and nurses should have been fired.At least 1,200 patients at Stafford Hospital were doomed to an early death because of a lack of care; people went for hours without food and water, with some being forced to drink from dirty vases; patients were left in pain when the wrong medication was handed out; people were not taken to the toilet and were forced to soil their beds; and privacy and dignity, even in death, were denied, said the damning report of a public inquiry.Staff treated patients and their loved ones with “callous indifference” and managers had “no culture” of listening to patients, it added.</additionalInformation>

      <additionalInformation>Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi – who represents William Shakespeare’s Stratford-upon-Avon – was making a speech about the Education Maintenance Allowance, says the BBC.He was wearing the red musical tie as part of an anti-cancer campaign he is supporting.The tinny tune played out for about 20 seconds as MPs looked around them to see what the noise was. Then, Zahawi realized what had happened: his tie had become inadvertently switched on. He switched it off.The deputy Speaker, Dawn Primarolo, told him: “Perhaps next time the honourable gentleman will be more selective in the ties he wears in the chamber and then we won’t need the musical accompaniment.”</additionalInformation>

      <additionalInformation>UK Prime Minister David Cameron officially apologized for the faults of the investigation of a deadly stampede that occurred at the Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield on April 15, 1989.The stampede occurred during the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest football clubs. It claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans and left more than 760 injured. Initially, the investigators blamed the fans and the structural deficiencies of the stadium.On Wednesday, the conclusions of an independent commission headed by Bishop James Jones were published. After analyzing over 400,000 pages of material, the commission disproved many of the claims made by the investigation following the tragedy.The commission has established that the stadium's infrastructure, including its turnstiles, fences and many of its seats, did not meet safety requirements. In addition, it was found that 116 witness statements were significantly amended, with negative comments about the police and medical operation edited out.The new independent investigation called into question the results of the alcohol tests, which were even taken from children. Doctors have also been criticized for ceasing the aid rendered to victims of the stampede too early and failing to save several people who were still alive.</additionalInformation>

      <additionalInformation>Navy submarine commanders have been ordered not to perform emergency surfacing drills with civilians aboard, pending the outcome of investigations into a submarine collision with a Japanese fishing vessel off Hawaii, Navy officials said Friday. As a precaution, submarine commanders also are not allowed to permit civilians at control stations, the officials said. Two civilians aboard the USS Greeneville were at control positions when the accident happened, although the Navy has said there is no evidence they played any role in the tragedy.At the Pentagon Friday, a Japanese foreign ministry official, Seishiro Eto, met with Deputy Defense Secretary Rudy de Leon to discuss last week's accident and prospects for recovering the ship and the nine missing. Eto, who did not comment to reporters upon arriving at the Pentagon, was scheduled to hold talks later at the State Department.President Bush said Thursday the Pentagon should review its policy on civilian participation in military exercises like the emergency ascent drill the Greeneville was performing when it sank the Japanese vessel."I think what's going to be necessary is for Secretary Rumsfeld and the Defense Department to review all policy regarding civilian activity during military exercises," Bush told reporters at the White House.However, civilians are still being allowed to take trips on U.S. submarines, Navy spokesman Cmdr. Greg Smith said Thursday night. Sixteen civilians were aboard the submarine when the accident happened.</additionalInformation>

        Apologizing to the victims of lynching and the descendants of those victims
        for the failure of the Senate to enact anti-lynching legislation.20 Senators refused to sign anti-lynching resolution.

        Ms. Landrieu (for herself, Mr. Allen, Mr. Levin, Mr. Frist, Mr. Reid, Mr. Allard, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bayh, Ms. Collins, Mr. Biden, Mr. Ensign, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Dayton, Mr. McCain, Mr. Dodd, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Specter, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Stevens, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr.Talent, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Pryor, and Mr. Schumer) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary
        Resolution
        Apologizing to the victims of lynching and the descendants of those victims
        for the failure of the Senate to enact anti-lynching legislation.
        Whereas the crime of lynching succeeded slavery as the ultimate expression of racism in the United States following Reconstruction;
        Whereas lynching was a widely acknowledged practice in the United States until the middle of the 20th century;
        Whereas lynching was a crime that occurred throughout the United States, with documented incidents in all but 4 States;
        Whereas at least 4,742 people, predominantly African-Americans, were reported lynched in the United States between 1882 and 1968;
        Whereas 99 percent of all perpetrators of lynching escaped from punishment by State or local officials;
        Whereas lynching prompted African-Americans to form the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and prompted members of B’nai B’rith to found the Anti-Defamation League;
        Whereas nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were introduced in Congress during the first half of the 20th century;
        Whereas, between 1890 and 1952, 7 Presidents petitioned Congress to end lynching;
        Whereas, between 1920 and 1940, the House of Representatives passed 3 strong anti-lynching measures;
        Whereas protection against lynching was the minimum and most basic of Federal responsibilities, and the Senate considered but failed to enact anti-lynching legislation despite repeated requests by civil rights groups, Presidents, and the House of Representatives to do so;
        Whereas the recent publication of ‘‘Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America’’ helped bring greater awareness and proper recognition of the victims of lynching;
        Whereas only by coming to terms with history can the United States effectively champion human rights abroad; and
        Whereas an apology offered in the spirit of true repentance moves the United States toward reconciliation and may become central to a new understanding, on which improved racial relations can be forged:
        Now, therefore, be it
        Resolved, That the Senate—
        (1) apologizes to the victims of lynching
        for the failure of the Senate to enact anti-lynching legislation;
        (2) expresses the deepest sympathies
        and most solemn regrets of the Senate to the descendants of victims of lynching, the ancestors of whom were deprived of life, human dignity, and the constitutional protections accorded all citizens of the United States; and
        (3) remembers the history of lynching, to ensure that these tragedies will be neither forgotten nor repeated.

        The U.S. Senate last night approved a resolution apologizing for its failure to enact federal anti-lynching legislation decades ago, marking the first time the body has apologized for the nation's treatment of African Americans.
        One-hundred and five years after the first anti-lynching bill was proposed by a black congressman, senators approved by a voice vote Resolution 39, which called for the lawmakers to apologize to lynching victims, survivors and their descendants, several of whom watched from the gallery.

        Good evening. This afternoon in this room, from this chair, I testified before the Office of Independent Counsel and the grand jury. I answered their questions truthfully, including questions about my private life, questions no American citizen would ever want to answer. Still, I must take complete responsibility for all my actions, both public and private. And that is why I am speaking to you tonight. As you know, in a deposition in January, I was asked questions about my relationship with Monica Lewinsky. While my answers were legally accurate, I did not volunteer information. Indeed, I did have a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was not appropriate. In fact, it was wrong. It constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a personal failure on my part for which I am solely and completely responsible. But I told the grand jury today and I say to you now that at no time did I ask anyone to lie, to hide or destroy evidence or to take any other unlawful action. I know that my public comments and my silence about this matter gave a false impression. I misled people, including even my wife. I deeply regret that. I can only tell you I was motivated by many factors. First, by a desire to protect myself from the embarrassment of my own conduct. I was also very concerned about protecting my family. The fact that these questions were being asked in a politically inspired lawsuit, which has since been dismissed, was a consideration, too. In addition, I had real and serious concerns about an independent counsel investigation that began with private business dealings 20 years ago - dealings, I might add, about which an independent federal agency found no evidence of any wrongdoing by me or my wife over two years ago. The independent counsel investigation moved on to my staff and friends, then into my private life. And now the investigation itself is under investigation. This has gone on too long, cost too much and hurt too many innocent people. Now, this matter is between me, the two people I love most - my wife and our daughter - and our God. I must put it right, and I am prepared to do whatever it takes to do so. Nothing is more important to me personally. But it is private, and I intend to reclaim my family life for my family. It's nobody's business but ours. Even presidents have private lives. It is time to stop the pursuit of personal destruction and the prying into private lives and get on with our national life. Our country has been distracted by this matter for too long,
        and I take my responsibility for my part in all of this.
        That is all I can do. Now it is time - in fact, it is past time - to move on. We have important work to do - real opportunities to seize, real problems to solve, real security matters to face. And so tonight, I ask you to turn away from the spectacle of the past seven months, to repair the fabric of our national discourse, and to return our attention to all the challenges and all the promise of the next American century. Thank you for watching. And good night.

        Earlier in the day, Clinton had become the first sitting President to give testimony before a grand jury in which he, the President, was the focus of the grand jury investigation. It was the latest in a long chain of legal entanglements resulting from a sweeping investigation of the President by Independent Counsel Ken Starr as well as a private lawsuit concerning alleged sexual harassment committed by Clinton before he became President.
        In this speech, Clinton publicly admitted for the first time he had a relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The admission occurred several months after a much publicized dramatic denial by the President. That denial had been staunchly defended by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, White House staffers, and various friends and supporters of the President.

      <name>Prime Minister apologizes for 1914 Komagata Maru incident</name>

        Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by acknowledging the hard work done by many of my colleagues. From my own caucus, I’d like to thank the Members from Surrey-Newton and Winnipeg North for their tireless advocacy. They have petitioned the Canadian government for years to make the apology that will be made today. I thank them for their commitment to this cause. From the Opposition benches, special mention must be made of the Members from Calgary Heritage, Calgary Midnapore and the former Member for Surrey North. Each deserves recognition for the work they have done to seek resolution for victims and their families. As do the many organizations that have sought the same, in particular, the Professor Mohan Singh Memorial Foundation. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in this House to offer an apology on behalf of the Government of Canada, for our role in the Komagata Maru incident. More than a century ago, a great injustice took place. On May 23, 1914, a steamship sailed into Burrard Inlet in Vancouver. On board were 376 passengers of Sikh, Muslim and Hindu origin. Those passengers, like millions of immigrants to Canada since, came seeking better lives for their families. Greater opportunities. A chance to contribute to their new home. Those passengers chose Canada. And when they arrived here, they were rejected. They were rejected because in the early years of the last century, the Government of Canada put in place a law that prohibited passengers from disembarking in Canada if the vessel they were on had stopped at any point during its journey here. This would have prevented immigrants from faraway countries such as India from entering Canada, because in that era, it was impossible to travel great distances by sea without making any stops. Because of this law, when the Komagata Maru arrived in Canada, only a small number of passengers were allowed to disembark. The ship, and all remaining passengers on it, was ordered to leave. Members of the local Sikh community tried to convince authorities to reverse their decision, but those efforts were unsuccessful. And on July 23, 1914 – two months after it arrived – the Komagata Maru was escorted out of harbour by the Canadian military, and forced to return to India, where 19 passengers were killed and many others imprisoned. Mr. Speaker, Canada does not bear alone the responsibility for every tagic mistake that occurred with the Komagata Maru and its passengers. But Canada’s government was, without question, responsible for the laws that prevented these passengers from immigrating peacefully and securely. For that, and for every regrettable consequence that followed,
        we are sorry.
        I apologize, first and foremost, to the victims of the incident. No words can fully erase the pain and suffering they experienced. Regrettably, the passage of time means that none are alive to hear our apology today. Still, we offer it, fully and sincerely. For our indifference to your plight. For our failure to recognize all that you had to offer. For the laws that discriminated against you, so senselessly. And for not formally apologizing sooner. For all these things, we are truly sorry. I also wish to apologize to the descendants of the passengers of the Komagata Maru, including those who are here with us here today. We can never know what your lives would have been like had your relatives been welcomed to Canada. The ways in which your lives would have been different. The ways in which Canada would have been enriched. Those possibilities are lost to history. For that – and to you – we apologize. Just as we apologize for past wrongs,
        so too must we commit ourselves to positive action – to learning from the mistakes of the past, and to making sure that we never repeat them.
        That is the unique promise and potential of Canada. We believe that every person – no matter who they are, no matter where they came from – deserves a real and fair chance at success. Canada’s South Asian community exemplifies this success every day. We believe that our diversity is a source of strength. That we are strong not in spite of our differences, but because of them. And we believe in the values enshrined in our Charter of Rights and Freedoms, including multiculturalism. Our government will ensure that these values are always upheld. Mr. Speaker, before I finish, I would like to acknowledge one more Member who has helped to bring the Komagata Maru incident to our national attention – the Minister of National Defence. Before entering political life, the Minister was the commanding officer of The British Columbia Regiment Duke of Connaught’s Own – the same regiment that once forced out the Komagata Maru. A century ago, the Minister’s family might well have been turned away from Canada. Today, the Minister sits beside us, here, in this House. In a House that includes immigrants. That includes the daughters and sons – the granddaughters and grandsons – of immigrants. The very makeup of this House should remind all of us that when we have the choice between opening our arms to those in need or closing our hearts to them, we must always choose the more compassionate path. When we see injustice, we must speak up, and attempt to make things right. When we make mistakes, we must apologize,
        and recommit ourselves to doing better.
        Mr. Speaker, Canada is a country unlike any other. We are blessed to call it home. Let us always endeavour to do better, and to be better. Let us do that in honour of the victims of the Komagata Maru incident, and every courageous person who leaves behind family and familiar things, to bring to Canada the very best of who they are. Thank you.

        Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rises in the House of Commons to apologise on behalf of the Canadian Government for the Komagata Maru incident that has been remembered as an example of Canada’s discriminatory immigration policies in the early 20th century.
        The Komagata Maru, a Japanese steamship, arrived in Burrard Inlet on May 23, 1914, carrying 376 British subjects from India, mainly Sikhs. Officials only allowed a small handful to leave the ship, forcing the rest to stay on board.
        Two months later, the ship returned to India. When it arrived, British India police in Calcutta shot 19 of the passengers.
        This year will mark the 102nd anniversary of the incident.

      <text>
        Thank you for being here tonight on this very solemn and somber occasion.
        I begin with an admission and an apology. First, I recognize fully that I am a balding, youngish, middle-aged straight, white, male, Republican, politician... with all of the expectations and privileges that come with those labels. I am probably not who you expected to hear from today.
        I'm here because, yesterday morning, 49 Americans were brutally murdered. !!!And it made me sad. And it made me angry. And it made me confused. !!! I'm here because those 49 people were gay. I'm here because it shouldn't matter. But I'm here because it does.
        I am not here to tell you that I know exactly what you are going through. I am not here to tell you that I feel your pain. I don't pretend to know the depths of what you are feeling right now. But I do know what it feels like to be scared. And I do know what it feels like to be sad. And I do know what it feels like to be rejected. And, more importantly, I know what it feels like to be loved. 'I grew up in a small town and went to a small rural high school. There were some kids in my class that were different. Sometimes I wasn't kind to them. I didn't know it at the time, but I know now that they were gay. I will forever regret not treating them with the kindness, dignity, and respect - the love - that they deserved. For that, I sincerely and humbly apologize.
        Over the intervening years, my heart has changed. It has changed because of you. It has changed because I have gotten to know many of you. You have been patient with me. You helped me learn the right letters of the alphabet in the right order even though you keep adding new ones. You have been kind to me. Jim Dabakis even told me I dressed nice once, even though I know he was lying. You have treated me with the kindness, dignity, and respect - the love - that I very often did NOT deserve. And it has made me love you.
        But now we are here. We are here because 49 beautiful, amazing people are gone. These are not just statistics. These were individuals. These are human beings. They each have a story. They each had dreams, goals, talents, friends, family. They are you and they are me. And one night they went out to relax, to laugh, to connect, to forget, to remember. And in a few minutes of chaos and terror, they were gone. 'I believe that we can all agree we have come a long way as a society when it comes to our acceptance and understanding of the LGBTQ community (did I get that right?).
        However, there has been something about this tragedy that has very much troubled me. I believe that there is a question, two questions actually, that each of us needs to ask ourselves in our heart of hearts. And I am speaking now to the straight community. How did you feel when you heard that 49 people had been gunned down by a self-proclaimed terrorist? That's the easy question. Here is the hard one: Did that feeling change when you found out the shooting was at a gay bar at 2 a.m. in the morning? If that feeling changed, then we are doing something wrong.
        So now we find ourselves at a crossroads. A crossroads of hate and terror. How do we respond? How do you respond? Do we lash out with anger, hate and mistrust? Or do we, as Lincoln begged, appeal to the better angels of our nature?
        Usually when tragedy occurs, we see our nation come together. I was saddened, yesterday to see far too many retreating to their over-worn policy corners and demagoguery. Let me be clear, there are no simple policy answers to this tragedy. Beware of anyone who tells you that they have the easy solution. It doesn't exist. And I can assure you this - that calling people idiots, communists, fascists or bigots on Facebook is not going to change any hearts or minds. Today we need fewer Republicans and fewer Democrats. Today we need more Americans.
        But just because an easy solution doesn't exist, doesn't mean we shouldn't try. The greatest generations in the history of the world were never innately great. They became great because of how they responded in the face of evil. Their humanity is measured by their response to ha
        I truly believe that this is the defining issue of our generation. Can we be brave? Can we be strong? Can we be kind and, perhaps, even happy, in the face of atrocious acts of hate and terrorism? Do we find a way to unite? Or do these atrocities further corrode and divide our torn nation? Can we, the citizens of the great state of Utah, lead the nation with love in the face of adversity? Can WE become a greatest generation?
        I promise we can. But I also promise it will never happen if we leave it to the politicians. Ultimately, there is only one way for us to come together. It must happen at a personal level. We must learn to truly love one another.
        The Prophet Muhammad is reported to have said: You will not enter paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another.
        Jesus said, 'Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you.
        Now, you know a little something about hate. And you know a little something about persecution. But you also know something about loving, blessing, and doing good. What our country needs more than ever is less politics and more kindness. If nothing else, as we can see here tonight, this tragedy has the potential to bring us closer than ever before.
        'And so may we leave today, with a resolve to be a little kinder. May we try to listen more and talk less. May we forgive someone that has wronged us. And perhaps, most importantly, try to love someone that is different than us. For my straight friends, might I suggest starting with someone who is gay.
        I leave you with the words of Lyndon B. Johnson. They were spoken at another very sad time in our history, the death of President John F. Kennedy. He said this:
        Our enemies have always made the same mistake. In my lifetime - in depression and in war - they have awaited our defeat. Each time, from the secret places of the American heart, came forth the faith they could not see or that they could not even imagine. It brought us victory. And it will again. For this is what America is all about.
        On behalf of the 3 million people of the state of Utah, We Are Orlando. We love you. And I love you.'

            <text>But I do know what it feels like to be scared. And I do know what it feels like to be sad. And I do know what it feels like to be rejected. We are here because 49 beautiful, amazing people are gone. These are not just statistics. These were individuals. These are human beings. They each have a story. They each had dreams, goals, talents, friends, family. They are you and they are me. And one night they went out to relax, to laugh, to connect, to forget, to remember. And in a few minutes of chaos and terror, they were gone.</text>
