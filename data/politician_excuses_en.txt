<s> This report I received today is a monumental document in more ways than one, but it is a very, very important piece of America’s history and it will shape America’s future in ways that will make us a more honorable, more successful, and more ethical country . </s>
<s> What this committee learned I would like to review today with a little more detail than Dr . </s>
<s> Fadren said because I think it must be engraved on our national memory . </s>
<s> Thousands of government sponsored experiments did take place at hospitals, universities and military bases around our nation . </s>
<s> The goal was to understand the effects of radiation exposure on the human body . </s>
<s> While most of tests were ethical by any standards, some were unethical, not only by today’s standards but by the standards in the time in which they were conducted . </s>
<s> They fail both the test of our national values and the test of humanity . </s>
<s> Informed consent means the doctor tells you the risk of the treatment you are about to undergo . </s>
<s> In too many cases informed consent was withheld . </s>
<s> Americans were kept in the dark about the effects of what was being done to them . </s>
<s> The deception extended beyond the test subjects themselves to encompass their families and the American people as a whole for these experiments were kept secret . </s>
<s> And they were shrouded not for a compelling reason of national security but for the simple fear of embarrassment, and that was wrong . </s>
<s> So today on behalf of another generation of American leaders and another generation of American citizens, the United States of America offers a sincere apology to those of our citizens who were subjected to these experiments, and to their families, and to their communities . </s>
<s> When the government does wrong we have a moral responsibility to admit it . </s>
<s> The duty we owe to one another to tell the truth and to protect our civil citizens from excesses like these is one we can never walk away from . </s>
<s> Our government failed in that duty and it offers an apology to the survivors and their families and to all the American people who must, who must, be able to rely upon the United States to keep its word, to tell the truth and to do the right thing . </s>
<s> Make no mistake, as the committee report says, there are circumstances where compensation is appropriate as a matter of ethics and principle . </s>
<s> I am committed to seeing to it that the United States of America lives up to its responsibility . </s>
<s> Our greatness is measured not only in how we so frequently do right but also how we act when we know we’ve done the wrong thing . </s>
<s> How we confront our mistakes, make our apologies, and take action . </s>
<s> That’s why this morning I signed an executive order instructing every arm and agency of our government that conducts, supports, or regulates research involving human beings to review immediately their procedures in light of recommendations of this report and the best knowledge and standards today and to report back to me by Christmas . </s>

<s> Mr . </s>
<s> Speaker, I stand before you today to offer an apology to former students of Indian residential schools . </s>
<s> The treatment of children in Indian residential schools is a sad chapter in our history . </s>
<s> In the 1870's, the federal government, partly in order to meet its obligation to educate aboriginal children, began to play a role in the development and administration of these schools . </s>
<s> Two primary objectives of the residential schools system were to remove and isolate children from the influence of their homes, families, traditions and cultures, and to assimilate them into the dominant culture . </s>
<s> These objectives were based on the assumption aboriginal cultures and spiritual beliefs were inferior and unequal . </s>
<s> Indeed, some sought, as it was infamously said, "to kill the Indian in the child . </s>
<s> "Today, we recognize that this policy of assimilation was wrong, has caused great harm, and has no place in our country . </s>
<s> Most schools were operated as "joint ventures" with Anglican, Catholic, Presbyterian or United churches . </s>
<s> The government of Canada built an educational system in which very young children were often forcibly removed from their homes, often taken far from their communities . </s>
<s> Many were inadequately fed, clothed and housed . </s>
<s> All were deprived of the care and nurturing of their parents, grandparents and communities . </s>
<s> First Nations, Inuit and Métis languages and cultural practices were prohibited in these schools . </s>
<s> Tragically, some of these children died while attending residential schools and others never returned home . </s>
<s> The government now recognizes that the consequences of the Indian residential schools policy were profoundly negative and that this policy has had a lasting and damaging impact on aboriginal culture, heritage and language . </s>
<s> While some former students have spoken positively about their experiences at residential schools, these stories are far overshadowed by tragic accounts of the emotional, physical and sexual abuse and neglect of helpless children, and their separation from powerless families and communities . </s>
<s> The legacy of Indian residential schools has contributed to social problems that continue to exist in many communities today . </s>
<s> It has taken extraordinary courage for the thousands of survivors that have come forward to speak publicly about the abuse they suffered . </s>
<s> It is a testament to their resilience as individuals and to the strength of their cultures . </s>
<s> Regrettably, many former students are not with us today and died never having received a full apology from the government of Canada . </s>
<s> The government recognizes that the absence of an apology has been an impediment to healing and reconciliation . </s>
<s> Therefore, on behalf of the government of Canada and all Canadians, I stand before you, in this chamber so central to our life as a country, to apologize to aboriginal peoples for Canada's role in the Indian residential schools system . </s>
<s> To the approximately 80,000 living former students, and all family members and communities, the government of Canada now recognizes that it was wrong to forcibly remove children from their homes and we apologize for having done this . </s>
<s> We now recognize that it was wrong to separate children from rich and vibrant cultures and traditions, that it created a void in many lives and communities, and we apologize for having done this . </s>
<s> We now recognize that, in separating children from their families, we undermined the ability of many to adequately parent their own children and sowed the seeds for generations to follow, and we apologize for having done this . </s>
<s> We now recognize that, far too often, these institutions gave rise to abuse or neglect and were inadequately controlled, and we apologize for failing to protect you . </s>
<s> Not only did you suffer these abuses as children, but as you became parents, you were powerless to protect your own children from suffering the same experience, and for this we are sorry . </s>
<s> The burden of this experience has been on your shoulders for far too long . </s>
<s> The burden is properly ours as a government, and as a country . </s>
<s> There is no place in Canada for the attitudes that inspired the Indian residential schools system to ever again prevail . </s>
<s> You have been working on recovering from this experience for a long time and in a very real sense, we are now joining you on this journey . </s>
<s> The government of Canada sincerely apologizes and asks the forgiveness of the aboriginal peoples of this country for failing them so profoundly . </s>
<s> We are sorry . </s>
<s> In moving towards healing, reconciliation and resolution of the sad legacy of Indian residential schools, implementation of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement agreement began on September 19, 2007 . </s>
<s> Years of work by survivors, communities, and aboriginal organizations culminated in an agreement that gives us a new beginning and an opportunity to move forward together in partnership . </s>
<s> A cornerstone of the settlement agreement is the Indian Residential Schools Truth and Reconciliation Commission . </s>
<s> This commission presents a unique opportunity to educate all Canadians on the Indian residential schools system . </s>
<s> It will be a positive step in forging a new relationship between aboriginal peoples and other Canadians, a relationship based on the knowledge of our shared history, a respect for each other and a desire to move forward together with a renewed understanding that strong families, strong communities and vibrant cultures and traditions will contribute to a stronger Canada for all of us . </s>
<s> To be clear, the picture was of me, and I sent it . </s>
<s> I'm deeply sorry for the pain this has caused my wife, and our family, my constituents, my friends, my supporters and my staff," "I lied because I was ashamed at what I had done, and I didn't want to get caught . </s>
<s> The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is publishing the report of the Saville inquiry - the tribunal set up by the previous government to investigate the tragic events of 30 January 1972, a day more commonly known as Bloody Sunday . </s>
<s> We have acted in good faith by publishing the tribunal's findings as soon as possible after the general election . </s>
<s> Mr Speaker, I am deeply patriotic . </s>
<s> I never want to believe anything bad about our country . </s>
<s> I never want to call into question the behaviour of our soldiers and our army, who I believe to be the finest in the world . </s>
<s> And I have seen for myself the very difficult and dangerous circumstances in which we ask our soldiers to serve . </s>
<s> But the conclusions of this report are absolutely clear . </s>
<s> There is no doubt, there is nothing equivocal, there are no ambiguities . </s>
<s> What happened on Bloody Sunday was both unjustified and unjustifiable . </s>
<s> It was wrong . </s>
<s> At a point in every person's life, one has to look deeply into the mirror of one's soul and decide one's unique truth in the world, not as we may want to see it or hope to see it, but as it is . </s>
<s> And so, my truth is that I am a gay American . </s>
<s> … Shamefully, I engaged in an adult consensual affair with another man, which violates my bonds of matrimony . </s>
<s> It was wrong . </s>
<s> It was foolish . </s>
<s> It was inexcusable . </s>
<s> And for this, I ask the forgiveness and the grace of my wife . </s>
<s> This was a very serious sin in my past for which I am, of course, completely responsible . </s>
<s> Several years ago, I asked for and received forgiveness from God and my wife in confession and marriage counseling . </s>
<s> Out of respect for my family, I will keep my discussion of the matter there - with God and them . </s>
<s> But I certainly offer my deep and sincere apologies to all I have disappointed and let down in any way . </s>
<s> I am deeply sorry that I did not live up to what was expected of me . </s>
<s> I will try once again outside of politics to serve the common good . </s>
<s> … Our greatest glory consists not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall . </s>
<s> I’m here today to again apologize for the personal mistakes I have made and the embarrassment I have caused . </s>
<s> I make this apology to my neighbors and constituents, but I make it particularly to my wife Huma . </s>
<s> I had hoped to be able to continue the work that the citizens of my district had elected me to do, to fight for the middle class and those struggling to make it . </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the distraction I have created has made that impossible . </s>
<s> a)	‘’On behalf of the people of South Carolina, I apologize for decades of suffering and pain caused by eugenics," b)	"Today, I want to acknowledge the great injustice done to more than 250 men and women when the State of South Carolina permitted involuntary sterilization for decades . </s>
<s> This evening I let my emotions get the best of me when listening to the president’s remarks regarding the coverage of illegal immigrants in the health care bill,” “While I disagree with the president’s statement, my comments were inappropriate and regrettable . </s>
<s> I extend sincere apologies to the president for this lack of civility . </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I was blind to how arrogant and self-centered I became," "This is how dangerous the feelings of power and adulation can be . </s>
<s> "I know that many of you were put in difficult situations because of me, and for that I sincerely apologize,"  "When I announced my personal failure two years ago, Larry Craig was one of the first to call . </s>
<s> I truly cannot tell you how much that meant to me," "I'm glad that the Lord not only forgives, but he actually likes it when we give him thanks . </s>
<s> So, Lord, thank you for all that you've done in my life . </s>
<s> I hope that I can do better in the future . </s>
<s> “The comments I made were just plain wrong, and in no way do they reflect what the university stands for . </s>
<s> They were a poor attempt at humor and entirely inappropriate . </s>
<s> There is no excuse for this, and I am deeply sorry . </s>
<s> I'm sorry the financial crisis has had such a devastating impact for our country . </s>
<s> I'm sorry about the millions of people, average Americans, who lost their homes . </s>
<s> And I'm sorry that our management teams, starting with me, like so many others could not see the unprecedented market collapse that lay before us . </s>
<s> I sincerely apologize to customers and the public for the company's failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements in Japan and we regret the concern and inconvenience caused . </s>
<s> I would like to reinforce Citigroup's commitment to Japan and our long-term commitment to our customers here . </s>
<s> Citigroup has been in Japan for more than 100 years and we will take all necessary steps to ensure business is properly conducted . </s>
<s> We regret very much the embarrassment that's been caused to you," "If I were there, Margaret,", "I'd throw my hat in the door before I came in . </s>
<s> "We regret very much the embarrassment that's been caused to you, and I would like to tell you what the story is from our end . </s>
<s> "We were greatly concerned because of a problem here - and not at your end at all - but here . </s>
<s> “I want to call to your attention the fact that I've taken time to go through the integrity commissioner's report on a formal complaint lodged against me while I was mayor of this great city . </s>

<s> “I understand the concerns brought forward in the report including the standards set out by the Ontario Human Rights Code . </s>
<s> “Mr . </s>

<s> Hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost and the country is still living with the devastating consequences of the war and the forces it unleashed . </s>
<s> They have paid the greatest price for the most serious foreign policy calamity of the last 60 years . </s>
<s> The apology is also owed to the families of those soldiers who died in Iraq or who have returned home injured or incapacitated . </s>
<s> They did their duty but it was in a conflict they should never have been sent to . </s>
<s> Finally, it is an apology to the millions of British citizens who feel our democracy was traduced and undermined by the way in which the decision to go to war was taken on the basic of secret ‘I will be with you, whatever’ understandings given to the US president that have now been publicly exposed . </s>

<s> On behalf of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, I extend this formal apology to Indian people for the historical conduct of this agency . </s>
<s> It was unacceptable and we’ve sent our apologies directly to the journalists, and we’ll make sure that this doesn’t happen again . </s>
<s> I have acted in a way that violates my obligations to my family and that violates my -- or any -- sense of right and wrong . </s>

<s> First, please let me apologize to my family, friends, staff and fellow Idahoans for the cloud placed over Idaho . </s>
<s> I did nothing wrong at the Minneapolis airport . </s>
<s> I regret my decision to plead guilty and the sadness that decision has brought to my wife, family, friends, staff, and fellow Idahoans . </s>
<s> For that I apologize . </s>
<s>  . </s>
<s>  . </s>
<s> Let me be clear . </s>
<s> I am not gay and never have been . </s>
<s> In June, I overreacted and made a poor decision . </s>
<s> While I was not involved in any inappropriate conduct at the Minneapolis airport or anywhere else, I chose to plead guilty to a lesser charge in the hope of making it go away . </s>
<s> I did not seek any counsel, either from an attorney, staff, friends, or family . </s>
<s> That was a mistake, and I deeply regret it . </s>
<s> Because of that, I have now retained counsel and I am asking my counsel to review this matter and to advise me on how to proceed . </s>
<s> For a moment, I want to put my state of mind into context on June 11 . </s>
<s> For eight months leading up to June, my family and I had been relentlessly and viciously harassed by the Idaho Statesman . </s>
<s> If you've seen today's paper, you know why . </s>
<s> Let me be clear: I am not gay and never have been . </s>
<s> Still, without a shred of truth or evidence to the contrary, the Statesman has engaged in this witch hunt . </s>
<s> In pleading guilty, I overreacted in Minneapolis, because of the stress of the Idaho Statesman's investigation and the rumors it has fueled around Idaho . </s>
<s> Again, that overreaction was a mistake, and I apologize for my misjudgment . </s>
<s> Furthermore, I should not have kept this arrest to myself, and should have told my family and friends about it . </s>
<s> I wasn't eager to share this failure, but I should have done so anyway . </s>
<s> I love my wife, family, friends, staff and Idaho . </s>
<s> I love serving Idaho in Congress . </s>
<s> Over the years, I have accomplished a lot for Idaho, and I hope Idahoans will allow me to continue to do that . </s>
<s> There are still goals I would like to accomplish, and I believe I can still be an effective leader for Idaho . </s>
<s> Next month, I will announce, as planned, whether or not I will seek re-election . </s>
<s> As an elected official, I fully realize that my life is open for public criticism and scrutiny, and I take full responsibility for the mistake in judgment I made in attempting to handle this matter myself . </s>
<s> It is clear, though, that through my actions I have brought a cloud over Idaho . </s>
<s> For that, I ask the people of Idaho for their forgiveness . </s>

<s> My dear Mr . </s>
<s> Nixon:I am concerned over the situation which has arisen because of the publishing of my letter of August 29th to Representative McDonough . </s>
<s> I have this date addressed a letter to the Commandant of the Marine Corps, a copy of which I am enclosing . </s>
<s> I should be happy to have you read my letter to the members of your organization . </s>
<s> Sincerely yours,HARRY S TRUMAN . </s>
<s> [Commandant Clay Nixon, Marine Corps League, Hotel Statler, Washington, D . </s>
<s> C . </s>
<s> ]Dear General Cates:I sincerely regret the unfortunate choice of language which I used in my letter of August 29 to Congressman McDonough concerning the Marine Corps . </s>
<s> What I had in mind at the time this letter was written was the specific question raised by Mr . </s>
<s> McDonough, namely the representation of the Marine Corps on the Joint Chiefs of Staff . </s>
<s> I have been disturbed by the number of communications which have been brought to my attention proposing that the Marine Corps have such representation . </s>
<s> I feel that, in as much as the Marine Corps is by law an integral part of the Department of the Navy, it is already represented on the Joint Chiefs of Staff by the Chief of Naval Operations . </s>
<s> That the Congress concurs in this point of view is evidenced by the fact that, in passing the National Security Act of 1947, and again in amending that Act in 1949, the Congress considered the question of Marine Corps representation on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and did not provide for it . </s>
<s> It is my feeling that many of the renewed pleas for such representation are the result of propaganda inspired by individuals who may not be aware of the best interests of our Defense Establishment as a whole, and it was this feeling which I was expressing to Mr . </s>
<s> McDonough . </s>
<s> I am certain that the Marine Corps itself does not indulge in such propaganda . </s>
<s> I am profoundly aware of the magnificent history of the United States Marine Corps, and of the many heroic deeds of the Marines since the Corps was established in 1775 . </s>
<s> I personally learned of the splendid combat spirit of the Marines when the Fourth Marine Brigade of the Second Infantry Division fought in France in 1918 . </s>
<s> On numerous occasions since I assumed office, I have stated my conviction that the Marine Corps has a vital role in our organization for national security and I will continue to support and maintain its identity . </s>
<s> I regard the Marine Corps as a force available for use in any emergency, wherever or whenever necessary . </s>
<s> When I spoke of the Marines as the "Navy's police force," I had in mind its immediate readiness, and the provision of the National Security Act which states that "The Marine Corps shall be organized, trained, and equipped to provide fleet marine forces of combined arms, together with supporting air components, for service with the fleet in the seizure or defense of advanced naval bases and for the conduct of such land operations as may be essential to the prosecution of a naval campaign . </s>
<s> "The Corps' ability to carry out whatever task may be assigned to it has been splendidly demonstrated many times in our history . </s>
<s> It has again been shown by the immediate response of the Marine Corps to a call for duty in Korea . </s>
<s> Since Marine ground and air forces have arrived in Korea I have received a daily report of their actions . </s>
<s> The country may feel sure that the record of the Marines now fighting there will add new laurels to the already illustrious record of the Marine Corps . </s>
<s> Sincerely yours,HARRY S . </s>
<s> A monetary sum and words alone cannot restore lost years or erase painful memories; neither can they fully convey our Nation’s resolve to rectify injustice and to uphold the rights of individuals . </s>
<s> We can never fully right the wrongs of the past . </s>

<s> Whereas the crime of lynching succeeded slavery as the ultimate expression of racism in the United States following Reconstruction;
        Whereas lynching was a widely acknowledged practice in the United States until the middle of the 20th century;
        Whereas lynching was a crime that occurred throughout the United States, with documented incidents in all but 4 States;
        Whereas at least 4,742 people, predominantly African-Americans, were reported lynched in the United States between 1882 and 1968;
        Whereas 99 percent of all perpetrators of lynching escaped from punishment by State or local officials;
        Whereas lynching prompted African-Americans to form the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and prompted members of B’nai B’rith to found the Anti-Defamation League;
        Whereas nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were introduced in Congress during the first half of the 20th century;
        Whereas, between 1890 and 1952, 7 Presidents petitioned Congress to end lynching;
        Whereas, between 1920 and 1940, the House of Representatives passed 3 strong anti-lynching measures;
        Whereas protection against lynching was the minimum and most basic of Federal responsibilities, and the Senate considered but failed to enact anti-lynching legislation despite repeated requests by civil rights groups, Presidents, and the House of Representatives to do so;
        Whereas the recent publication of ‘‘Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America’’ helped bring greater awareness and proper recognition of the victims of lynching;
        Whereas only by coming to terms with history can the United States effectively champion human rights abroad; and
        Whereas an apology offered in the spirit of true repentance moves the United States toward reconciliation and may become central to a new understanding, on which improved racial relations can be forged:
        Now, therefore, be it
        Resolved, That the Senate—
        (1) apologizes to the victims of lynching
        for the failure of the Senate to enact anti-lynching legislation;
        (2) expresses the deepest sympathies
        and most solemn regrets of the Senate to the descendants of victims of lynching, the ancestors of whom were deprived of life, human dignity, and the constitutional protections accorded all citizens of the United States; and

<s> Good evening . </s>
<s> This afternoon in this room, from this chair, I testified before the Office of Independent Counsel and the grand jury . </s>
<s> I answered their questions truthfully, including questions about my private life, questions no American citizen would ever want to answer . </s>
<s> Still, I must take complete responsibility for all my actions, both public and private . </s>
<s> And that is why I am speaking to you tonight . </s>
<s> As you know, in a deposition in January, I was asked questions about my relationship with Monica Lewinsky . </s>
<s> While my answers were legally accurate, I did not volunteer information . </s>
<s> Indeed, I did have a relationship with Ms . </s>
<s> Lewinsky that was not appropriate . </s>
<s> In fact, it was wrong . </s>
<s> It constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a personal failure on my part for which I am solely and completely responsible . </s>
<s> But I told the grand jury today and I say to you now that at no time did I ask anyone to lie, to hide or destroy evidence or to take any other unlawful action . </s>
<s> I know that my public comments and my silence about this matter gave a false impression . </s>
<s> I misled people, including even my wife . </s>
<s> I deeply regret that . </s>
<s> I can only tell you I was motivated by many factors . </s>
<s> First, by a desire to protect myself from the embarrassment of my own conduct . </s>
<s> I was also very concerned about protecting my family . </s>
<s> The fact that these questions were being asked in a politically inspired lawsuit, which has since been dismissed, was a consideration, too . </s>
<s> In addition, I had real and serious concerns about an independent counsel investigation that began with private business dealings 20 years ago - dealings, I might add, about which an independent federal agency found no evidence of any wrongdoing by me or my wife over two years ago . </s>
<s> The independent counsel investigation moved on to my staff and friends, then into my private life . </s>
<s> And now the investigation itself is under investigation . </s>
<s> This has gone on too long, cost too much and hurt too many innocent people . </s>
<s> Now, this matter is between me, the two people I love most - my wife and our daughter - and our God . </s>
<s> I must put it right, and I am prepared to do whatever it takes to do so . </s>
<s> Nothing is more important to me personally . </s>
<s> But it is private, and I intend to reclaim my family life for my family . </s>
<s> It's nobody's business but ours . </s>
<s> Even presidents have private lives . </s>
<s> It is time to stop the pursuit of personal destruction and the prying into private lives and get on with our national life . </s>
<s> Our country has been distracted by this matter for too long,
        and I take my responsibility for my part in all of this . </s>
<s> That is all I can do . </s>
<s> Now it is time - in fact, it is past time - to move on . </s>
<s> We have important work to do - real opportunities to seize, real problems to solve, real security matters to face . </s>
<s> And so tonight, I ask you to turn away from the spectacle of the past seven months, to repair the fabric of our national discourse, and to return our attention to all the challenges and all the promise of the next American century . </s>
<s> Thank you for watching . </s>
<s> And good night . </s>
<s> Mr . </s>
<s> Speaker, I would like to begin by acknowledging the hard work done by many of my colleagues . </s>
<s> From my own caucus, I’d like to thank the Members from Surrey-Newton and Winnipeg North for their tireless advocacy . </s>
<s> They have petitioned the Canadian government for years to make the apology that will be made today . </s>
<s> I thank them for their commitment to this cause . </s>
<s> From the Opposition benches, special mention must be made of the Members from Calgary Heritage, Calgary Midnapore and the former Member for Surrey North . </s>
<s> Each deserves recognition for the work they have done to seek resolution for victims and their families . </s>
<s> As do the many organizations that have sought the same, in particular, the Professor Mohan Singh Memorial Foundation . </s>
<s> Mr . </s>
<s> Speaker, today I rise in this House to offer an apology on behalf of the Government of Canada, for our role in the Komagata Maru incident . </s>
<s> More than a century ago, a great injustice took place . </s>
<s> On May 23, 1914, a steamship sailed into Burrard Inlet in Vancouver . </s>
<s> On board were 376 passengers of Sikh, Muslim and Hindu origin . </s>
<s> Those passengers, like millions of immigrants to Canada since, came seeking better lives for their families . </s>
<s> Greater opportunities . </s>
<s> A chance to contribute to their new home . </s>
<s> Those passengers chose Canada . </s>
<s> And when they arrived here, they were rejected . </s>
<s> They were rejected because in the early years of the last century, the Government of Canada put in place a law that prohibited passengers from disembarking in Canada if the vessel they were on had stopped at any point during its journey here . </s>
<s> This would have prevented immigrants from faraway countries such as India from entering Canada, because in that era, it was impossible to travel great distances by sea without making any stops . </s>
<s> Because of this law, when the Komagata Maru arrived in Canada, only a small number of passengers were allowed to disembark . </s>
<s> The ship, and all remaining passengers on it, was ordered to leave . </s>
<s> Members of the local Sikh community tried to convince authorities to reverse their decision, but those efforts were unsuccessful . </s>
<s> And on July 23, 1914 – two months after it arrived – the Komagata Maru was escorted out of harbour by the Canadian military, and forced to return to India, where 19 passengers were killed and many others imprisoned . </s>
<s> Mr . </s>
<s> Speaker, Canada does not bear alone the responsibility for every tagic mistake that occurred with the Komagata Maru and its passengers . </s>
<s> But Canada’s government was, without question, responsible for the laws that prevented these passengers from immigrating peacefully and securely . </s>
<s> For that, and for every regrettable consequence that followed,
        we are sorry . </s>
<s> I apologize, first and foremost, to the victims of the incident . </s>
<s> No words can fully erase the pain and suffering they experienced . </s>
<s> Regrettably, the passage of time means that none are alive to hear our apology today . </s>
<s> Still, we offer it, fully and sincerely . </s>
<s> For our indifference to your plight . </s>
<s> For our failure to recognize all that you had to offer . </s>
<s> For the laws that discriminated against you, so senselessly . </s>
<s> And for not formally apologizing sooner . </s>
<s> For all these things, we are truly sorry . </s>
<s> I also wish to apologize to the descendants of the passengers of the Komagata Maru, including those who are here with us here today . </s>
<s> We can never know what your lives would have been like had your relatives been welcomed to Canada . </s>
<s> The ways in which your lives would have been different . </s>
<s> The ways in which Canada would have been enriched . </s>
<s> Those possibilities are lost to history . </s>
<s> For that – and to you – we apologize . </s>
<s> Just as we apologize for past wrongs,
        so too must we commit ourselves to positive action – to learning from the mistakes of the past, and to making sure that we never repeat them . </s>
<s> That is the unique promise and potential of Canada . </s>
<s> We believe that every person – no matter who they are, no matter where they came from – deserves a real and fair chance at success . </s>
<s> Canada’s South Asian community exemplifies this success every day . </s>
<s> We believe that our diversity is a source of strength . </s>
<s> That we are strong not in spite of our differences, but because of them . </s>
<s> And we believe in the values enshrined in our Charter of Rights and Freedoms, including multiculturalism . </s>
<s> Our government will ensure that these values are always upheld . </s>
<s> Mr . </s>
<s> Speaker, before I finish, I would like to acknowledge one more Member who has helped to bring the Komagata Maru incident to our national attention – the Minister of National Defence . </s>
<s> Before entering political life, the Minister was the commanding officer of The British Columbia Regiment Duke of Connaught’s Own – the same regiment that once forced out the Komagata Maru . </s>
<s> A century ago, the Minister’s family might well have been turned away from Canada . </s>
<s> Today, the Minister sits beside us, here, in this House . </s>
<s> In a House that includes immigrants . </s>
<s> That includes the daughters and sons – the granddaughters and grandsons – of immigrants . </s>
<s> The very makeup of this House should remind all of us that when we have the choice between opening our arms to those in need or closing our hearts to them, we must always choose the more compassionate path . </s>
<s> When we see injustice, we must speak up, and attempt to make things right . </s>
<s> When we make mistakes, we must apologize,
        and recommit ourselves to doing better . </s>
<s> Mr . </s>
<s> Speaker, Canada is a country unlike any other . </s>
<s> We are blessed to call it home . </s>
<s> Let us always endeavour to do better, and to be better . </s>
<s> Let us do that in honour of the victims of the Komagata Maru incident, and every courageous person who leaves behind family and familiar things, to bring to Canada the very best of who they are . </s>
<s> Thank you . </s>

<s> I'm here because, yesterday morning, 49 Americans were brutally murdered . </s>
<s> !!!And it made me sad . </s>
<s> And it made me angry . </s>
<s> And it made me confused . </s>
<s> !!! I'm here because those 49 people were gay . </s>
<s> I'm here because it shouldn't matter . </s>
<s> But I'm here because it does . </s>
<s> I am not here to tell you that I know exactly what you are going through . </s>
<s> I am not here to tell you that I feel your pain . </s>
<s> I don't pretend to know the depths of what you are feeling right now . </s>
<s> But I do know what it feels like to be scared . </s>
<s> And I do know what it feels like to be sad . </s>
<s> And I do know what it feels like to be rejected . </s>
<s> And, more importantly, I know what it feels like to be loved . </s>
<s> 'I grew up in a small town and went to a small rural high school . </s>
<s> There were some kids in my class that were different . </s>
<s> Sometimes I wasn't kind to them . </s>
<s> I didn't know it at the time, but I know now that they were gay . </s>
<s> I will forever regret not treating them with the kindness, dignity, and respect - the love - that they deserved . </s>
<s> For that, I sincerely and humbly apologize . </s>
<s> Over the intervening years, my heart has changed . </s>
<s> It has changed because of you . </s>
<s> It has changed because I have gotten to know many of you . </s>
<s> You have been patient with me . </s>
<s> You helped me learn the right letters of the alphabet in the right order even though you keep adding new ones . </s>
<s> You have been kind to me . </s>
<s> Jim Dabakis even told me I dressed nice once, even though I know he was lying . </s>
<s> You have treated me with the kindness, dignity, and respect - the love - that I very often did NOT deserve . </s>
<s> And it has made me love you . </s>
<s> But now we are here . </s>
<s> We are here because 49 beautiful, amazing people are gone . </s>
<s> These are not just statistics . </s>
<s> These were individuals . </s>
<s> These are human beings . </s>
<s> They each have a story . </s>
<s> They each had dreams, goals, talents, friends, family . </s>
<s> They are you and they are me . </s>
<s> And one night they went out to relax, to laugh, to connect, to forget, to remember . </s>
<s> And in a few minutes of chaos and terror, they were gone . </s>
<s> 'I believe that we can all agree we have come a long way as a society when it comes to our acceptance and understanding of the LGBTQ community (did I get that right?) . </s>
<s> However, there has been something about this tragedy that has very much troubled me . </s>
<s> I believe that there is a question, two questions actually, that each of us needs to ask ourselves in our heart of hearts . </s>
<s> And I am speaking now to the straight community . </s>
<s> How did you feel when you heard that 49 people had been gunned down by a self-proclaimed terrorist? That's the easy question . </s>
<s> Here is the hard one: Did that feeling change when you found out the shooting was at a gay bar at 2 a . </s>
<s> m . </s>
<s> in the morning? If that feeling changed, then we are doing something wrong . </s>
<s> So now we find ourselves at a crossroads . </s>
<s> A crossroads of hate and terror . </s>
<s> How do we respond? How do you respond? Do we lash out with anger, hate and mistrust? Or do we, as Lincoln begged, appeal to the better angels of our nature?
        Usually when tragedy occurs, we see our nation come together . </s>
<s> I was saddened, yesterday to see far too many retreating to their over-worn policy corners and demagoguery . </s>
<s> Let me be clear, there are no simple policy answers to this tragedy . </s>
<s> Beware of anyone who tells you that they have the easy solution . </s>
<s> It doesn't exist . </s>
<s> And I can assure you this - that calling people idiots, communists, fascists or bigots on Facebook is not going to change any hearts or minds . </s>
<s> Today we need fewer Republicans and fewer Democrats . </s>
<s> Today we need more Americans . </s>
<s> But just because an easy solution doesn't exist, doesn't mean we shouldn't try . </s>
<s> The greatest generations in the history of the world were never innately great . </s>
<s> They became great because of how they responded in the face of evil . </s>
<s> Their humanity is measured by their response to ha
        I truly believe that this is the defining issue of our generation . </s>
<s> Can we be brave? Can we be strong? Can we be kind and, perhaps, even happy, in the face of atrocious acts of hate and terrorism? Do we find a way to unite? Or do these atrocities further corrode and divide our torn nation? Can we, the citizens of the great state of Utah, lead the nation with love in the face of adversity? Can WE become a greatest generation?
        I promise we can . </s>
<s> But I also promise it will never happen if we leave it to the politicians . </s>
<s> Ultimately, there is only one way for us to come together . </s>
<s> It must happen at a personal level . </s>
<s> We must learn to truly love one another . </s>
<s> The Prophet Muhammad is reported to have said: You will not enter paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another . </s>
<s> Jesus said, 'Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you . </s>
<s> Now, you know a little something about hate . </s>
<s> And you know a little something about persecution . </s>
<s> But you also know something about loving, blessing, and doing good . </s>
<s> What our country needs more than ever is less politics and more kindness . </s>
<s> If nothing else, as we can see here tonight, this tragedy has the potential to bring us closer than ever before . </s>
<s> 'And so may we leave today, with a resolve to be a little kinder . </s>
<s> May we try to listen more and talk less . </s>
<s> May we forgive someone that has wronged us . </s>
<s> And perhaps, most importantly, try to love someone that is different than us . </s>
<s> For my straight friends, might I suggest starting with someone who is gay . </s>
<s> I leave you with the words of Lyndon B . </s>
<s> Johnson . </s>
<s> They were spoken at another very sad time in our history, the death of President John F . </s>
<s> Kennedy . </s>
<s> He said this:
        Our enemies have always made the same mistake . </s>
<s> In my lifetime - in depression and in war - they have awaited our defeat . </s>
<s> Each time, from the secret places of the American heart, came forth the faith they could not see or that they could not even imagine . </s>
<s> It brought us victory . </s>
<s> And it will again . </s>
<s> For this is what America is all about . </s>
<s> On behalf of the 3 million people of the state of Utah, We Are Orlando . </s>
<s> We love you . </s>
<s> And I love you . </s>
